\begin{exercise}

Calculate the value of $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k^2}{2+3k^4}$ to within $.0001$ of its exact value.  Use technology to perform all necessary computations.

To within $.0001$, we find that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k^2}{2+3k^4} \approx \answer[tolerance=.00007]{.411266}$
\begin{hint}
This would be a nasty integral to compute.  However, the point of this exercise is to use technology, so take advantage of it!  By using technology to solve $\int_N^{N+1} \frac{x^2}{2+3x^4} \d x =.001$, we find that $N = \answer{58}$ (remember to round up).  The error estimates can now be used to find a range of possible values for the series.
