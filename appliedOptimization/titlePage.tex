\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item Recognize optimization problems.
\item Translate a word problem into the problem of finding the extreme values of a function.
\item Solve basic word problems involving maxima or minima.
\item Interpret an optimization problem as the procedure used to make a system or design as effective or functional as possible.
\item Set up an optimization problem by identifying the objective function and appropriate constraints.
\item Solve optimization problems by finding the appropriate absolute extremum.
\item Identify the appropriate domain for functions which are models of real-world phenomena.   
%\item Recognize real-world failures of short-term versus long-term optimization.   
\end{itemize}
