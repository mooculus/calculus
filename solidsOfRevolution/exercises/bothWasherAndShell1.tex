\begin{exercise}

The region $R$ bounded by the curves $x=y^{2}$ and $x-2y=15$ is revolved about the line $x=-2$. 

To use the Washer Method to set up an integral or sum of integrals that would give the volume of the solid: 

  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{we should integrate with respect to $x$.}
    \choice[correct]{we should integrate with respect to $y$.}
  \end{multipleChoice}

How many integrals will we need to express the volume of the solid using the Washer Method: $\answer{1}$


\begin{exercise} 
Express the volume of the solid using the Washer Method: 
\[
V=\int_{\answer{-3}}^{\answer{5}} \answer{\pi \left(2+2y+15 \right)^{2}-\pi \left( 2+y^{2}\right)^{2}} \d y 
\] 


\end{exercise}
\end{exercise}

To use the Shell Method to set up an integral or sum of integrals that would give the volume of the solid: 

  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{we should integrate with respect to $x$.}
    \choice{we should integrate with respect to $y$.}
  \end{multipleChoice}

How many integrals will we need to express the volume of the solid using the Shell method: $\answer{2}$. 


\begin{exercise}
Express the volume of the solid using the Shell Method: 
\[
V=\int_{\answer{0}}^{\answer{9}} \answer{2\pi \left( 2+x \right) \left(2 \sqrt{x} \right)} \d x + \int_{\answer{9}}^{\answer{25}} \answer{ 2\pi \left( 2 +x \right) \left( \sqrt{x} - \frac{1}{2}\left( x -15 \right) \right) } \d x 
\]
