\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify situations where logs can be used to help find derivatives.
	\item Use logarithmic differentiation to simplify taking derivatives.
	\item Take derivatives of logarithms and exponents of all bases.
	\item Take derivatives of functions raised to functions.
	\item Apply the generalized power rule.
	\item Recognize the difference between a variable as the base and a variable as the exponent.
	\item Work with the inverse properties of $e^x$ and $\ln(x)$.
\end{itemize}
