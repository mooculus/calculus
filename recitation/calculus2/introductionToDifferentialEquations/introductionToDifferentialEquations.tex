\section{Discussion Questions}

\begin{problem} 

Give the order of the following ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then, determine if they are linear or nonlinear.

\begin{tabular}{lll}
I. $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+3x \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^4  = y^3$ \qquad & II. $\frac{d^3y}{dx^3} + 2xy\frac{dy}{dx} = x^2$  \qquad & III. $\frac{d^4y}{dx^4}+\frac{dy}{dx} -x^2y=e^{3x}$
\end{tabular}

\begin{freeResponse}
I. Writing 
$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}  =  y^3 - 3x \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^4,
$$
we see that this is a second-order differential equation. Since the right-hand side is not linear in $y$ or $\frac{\d y}{\d x}$ due to the exponents on the terms $y^3$ and $\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^4$, this differential equation is nonlinear.

II. The equation
$$
\frac{d^3y}{dx^3} = - 2xy\frac{dy}{dx} + x^2
$$
is third-order and nonlinear, due to the presence of the product $y \frac{\d y}{\d x}$. 

III. Rewriting the equation as 
$$
\frac{d^4y}{dx^4} = -\frac{dy}{dx} + x^2y + e^{3x},
$$
we see that it is fourth-order and linear, since it is linear in $y$ and $\frac{\d y}{\d x}$. 
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem} 
For which of the following differential equations is $y=5e^{2x}$ a solution?

\begin{tabular}{lll}
I. $y'=5e^{2x}$ \qquad \qquad \qquad & II. $y''-3y'-y =0$ \qquad \qquad \qquad & III. $y^2\frac{dy}{dx}=50e^{2x}$
\end{tabular}

\begin{freeResponse}
First note that 
$$
y' = 10 e^{2x}
$$
and
$$
y'' = 20 e^{2x}.
$$

I. Since 
$$
y' = 10 e^{2x} \neq 5 e^{2x},
$$
$y$ is not a solution of this equation.

II. Substituting $y$ and its derivatives into the equation, we have
$$
y''-3y'-y = 20e^{2x}-3 \cdot 10e^{2x} - 5e^{2x} = -15 e^{2x} \neq 0,
$$
so $y$ is not a solution.

III. We have 
$$
y^2 \frac{dy}{dx} = \left(5e^{2x}\right)^2 \cdot 10e^{2x} = 250 e^{6x} \neq 50 e^{2x},
$$
so $y$ is not a solution of the equation.
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\section{Group Work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}
Explain whether $y= \sqrt{1-x^2}$ is a solution to the initial value problem (IVP)  below. $$\frac{dy}{dx} +\frac{2x}{y} =0, \quad y(0)=1$$

\begin{freeResponse}
We first calculate
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{2} (1-x^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2x) = -\frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}.
$$
Substituting this into the equation, we have
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} +\frac{2x}{y} = -\frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} + \frac{2x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \neq 0.
$$
Therefore $y$ is not a solution of the IVP.
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} 
Consider the IVP: $$\frac{dy}{dx} +xy =0, \quad y(0)=1.$$  

\begin{itemize}
\item[I.]  Let $y=f(x)$ be a solution of the initial value problem.  Find the equation of the tangent line to $y=f(x)$ at $x=0$.
\item[II.] Find  $y''(0)$.
%Jim's Note: They WILL forget product rule.  please emphasize they do not have to solve the ODE to to this and point out PR is necessary.
\end{itemize}

\begin{freeResponse}
One approach to solving these types of problems would be to solve the IVP for $f(x)$, then answer the questions directly using the function. On the other hand, we can use the IVP to derive the necessary properties of $f(x)$ without solving for it explicitly. This is the approach we will take.

I. We have $f(0) = y(0) = 1$ and 
$$
f'(0) = \left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x=0} = \left.-xy\right|_{x=0} = 0.
$$
Therefore the tangent line to $y=f(x)$ at $x=0$ is the horizontal line $y=1$. 

II. From the differential equation, we have
$$
y' = -xy,
$$
and it follows that
$$
y'' = \frac{d}{dx}(-xy) = -y - xy'
$$
(remember that the product rule must be applied to take the derivative). Evaluating at $x=0$, we have
$$
y''(0) = -y(0)-0 \cdot y'(0) = -1.
$$
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem} 
Find a function $f(x)$ so $y=\sin(x^2)$ is a solution to the ODE $\frac{dy}{dx}+4xy = f(x)$.

\begin{freeResponse}
The derivative of $y$ is 
$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \cos(x^2)\cdot 2x.
$$
Substituting this into the left hand side of the ODE, we have
$$
2x \cos(x^2)  + 4x \sin(x^2) = f(x).
$$
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem} 
Consider the differential equation $y''-4y'-5y = 0$.  Find all real values for the parameter $a$ such that $y=Ce^{ax}$ is a solution to the differential equation or explain why no such values exist.

\begin{freeResponse}
The derivatives of $y$ are 
$$
y' = aC e^{ax}
$$
and 
$$
y'' = a^2 C e^{ax}.
$$
Substituting this into the differential equation, we have
$$
y'' - 4y' -5y = a^2 C e^{ax} - 4 aC e^{ax} - 5Ce^{ax} = C e^{ax}\left(a^2 - 4a - 5\right) = 0.
$$
Therefore it must be that $C e^{ax} = 0$ or $a^2 - 4a - 5 = 0$. The first equation holds if and only if $C = 0$. We solve the second equation by factoring
$$
(a-5)(a+1) = 0,
$$ 
so that $a=-1$ or $a=5$. We conclude that if $C=0$ then all values of $a$ give a solution (but in this case $y=Ce^{ax} = 0$), and if $C \neq 0$, then $a=-1$ or $5$. 
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem} 
Find values of $a_1$ and $a_2$ for which $y(x) = a _1 e^{-3x}+a_2$ is a solution to the initial value problem below or explain why no such values of $a_1$ and $a_2$ exist.  $$y'(x) +3y(x) = 9  , \qquad y(0) = -1 $$

\begin{freeResponse}
The derivative of $y$ is 
$$
y' = -3 a_1 e^{-3x}.
$$
For $y$ to solve the IVP, we need
$$
y' + 3y = -3a_1 e^{-3x} + 3a_1 e^{-3x} + 3 a_2 = 3 a_2 = 9.
$$
Therefore $a_2 = 3$. The IVP also requires 
$$
y(0) = a_1 e^{-3 \cdot 0} + a_2 = a_1 + 3 = -1.
$$
Therefore $a_1 = -4$.
