\section{What are rational functions?}
In algebra and calculus, polynomials play the same role as the integers do in arithmetic.  We add them, subtract them, multiply them, and factor them.  We cannot 
divide them, however, if we only allow integer results.  (Since $4$ is not a factor of $7$, the quotient $\dfrac{7}{4}$ is not an integer.)  If we want to be able to
divide integers, we end up with \emph{rational numbers}, which are fractions $\dfrac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers, and $q \ne 0$.

The same idea holds for polynomials.  We can add them, subtract them, multiply them, and factor them.  However, to divide them we have to start
considering rational functions.

\begin{definition}
  A \dfn{rational function} in the variable $x$ is a function \emph{which can be written} in the form
  \[
  f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}
  \]
  where $p$ and $q$ are polynomial functions. The domain of a rational
  function is all real numbers except for where the denominator is
  equal to zero.
\end{definition}

If $p$ is a polynomial function, then it can be written in the form $\dfrac{p(x)}{1}$, showing that any polynomial function is
also a rational function. Since a rational function has zeroes only where the numerator polynomial has zeroes 
(as long as the fraction is written in lowest terms), functions like $\sin(x)$ which have infinitely many zeroes cannot be rational functions.

\begin{question}
  Which of the following are rational functions?
  \begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = 0$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = \frac{3x+1}{x^2-4x+5}$}
    \choice{$f(x)=e^x$}
    \choice{$f(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = -4x^{3}+5x^{2}-18x+7$}
    \choice{$f(x) = x^{1/2}-x +8$}
    \choice{$f(x)=\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x^3-x}$}
  \end{selectAll}
  \begin{feedback}
    All polynomials can be thought of as rational functions.
  \end{feedback}
\end{question}



\section{What can the graphs look like?}

There is a somewhat wide variation in the graphs of rational
functions.

\begin{example}
    Here we see the the graphs of four rational functions.
\begin{image}
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \begin{axis}[
          xmin=-30,xmax=30,
            ymin=-30,ymax=30,
            domain=-2:2,
            width=2.5in,
            axis lines =middle, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
        ]
	\addplot [very thick, penColor, smooth, samples=100, domain=-30:-2.2] {(x^2-3*x+2)/(x+2)};
       	\addplot [very thick, penColor, smooth, samples=100, domain=-1.8:30] {(x^2-3*x+2)/(x+2)};

        \node at (axis cs:10,15) [penColor,anchor=west] {$A$};          
      \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    &
    \begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
            xmin=-2,xmax=4,
            ymin=-3,ymax=3,
            width=2.5in,
            axis lines =middle, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
          ]
	  \addplot [very thick, penColor2, domain=-2:.9] {1/(x-1)};
          \addplot [very thick, penColor2, domain=1.1:4] {1/(x-1)};
          \addplot[color=penColor2,fill=background,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(2,1)};  %% open hole
          \node at (axis cs:2.5,1.3) [penColor2] {$B$};
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
        \\
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \begin{axis}[
          xmin=-1,xmax=5,
          ymin=-30,ymax=30,
          width=2.5in,
          axis lines =middle, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
          every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
          every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
        ]
        \addplot [very thick, penColor3, smooth, samples=100, domain=-1:.95] {(x+2)/(x^2-3*x+2)};
        \addplot [very thick, penColor3, smooth, samples=100, domain=1.1:1.9]  {(x+2)/(x^2-3*x+2)};
        \addplot [very thick, penColor3, smooth, samples=100, domain=2.1:5]  {(x+2)/(x^2-3*x+2)};
        \node at (axis cs:3,7) [penColor3] {$C$};
      \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    &
 \begin{tikzpicture}
      \begin{axis}[
          xmin=-2,xmax=4,
          ymin=-3,ymax=3,
          domain=-2:4,
          width=2.5in,
          axis lines =middle, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
          every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
          every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
        ]
	\addplot [very thick, penColor4] {x-1};
        \addplot[color=penColor4,fill=background,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(2,1)};  %% open hole
        \node at (axis cs:3,1.5) [penColor4] {$D$};
      \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{tabular}
\end{image}
Match the curves $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ with the functions
  \begin{align*}
    &\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-2}, &&\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x+2}, \\
    &\frac{x-2}{x^2-3x+2}, &&\frac{x+2}{x^2-3x+2}.
  \end{align*}
\begin{explanation}
  Consider $\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x-2}$. This function is undefined only at
  $x=2$. Of the curves that we see above, $\answer[given]{D}$ is
  undefined exactly at $x=2$.

  Now consider $\frac{x^2-3x+2}{x+2}$. This function is undefined only
  at $x=-2$. The only function above that undefined exactly at $x=-2$
  is curve $\answer[given]{A}$.

  Now consider $\frac{x-2}{x^2-3x+2}$. This function is undefined at
  the roots of
  \[
  x^2-3x+2 = (x-2)(x-1).
  \]
  Hence it is undefined at $x=2$ and $x=1$. It looks like both curves
  $B$ and $C$ would work. Distinguishing between these two curves is
  easy enough if we evaluate at $x=-2$. Check it out.
  \begin{align*}
    \eval{\frac{x-2}{x^2-3x+2}}_{x=-2} &= \frac{-2-2}{(-2)^2-3(-2)+2}\\
    &= \frac{-4}{4+6+2}\\
    &=\frac{-4}{12}.
  \end{align*}
  Since this is negative, we see that $\frac{x-2}{x^2-3x+2}$
  corresponds to curve $\answer[given]{B}$.

  Finally, it must be the case that curve $\answer[given]{C}$
  corresponds to $\frac{x+2}{x^2-3x+2}$. We should note that if this
  function is evaluated at $x=-2$, the output is zero, and this
  corroborates our work above.
\end{explanation}
