\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implicitly differentiate expressions.
	%\item Solve equations for $\dd[y]{x}$.
	\item Find the equation of the tangent line for curves that
          are not plots of functions.
	\item Understand how changing the variable changes how we take
          the derivative.
	\item Understand the derivatives of expressions that are not
          functions or not solved for $y$.
\end{itemize}
