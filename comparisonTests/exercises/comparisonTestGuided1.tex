\begin{exercise}

Consider the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4+\sin(k)}{k^2}$.  

Is the series geometric or a $p$-series?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{The series is a geometric series.}
\choice{The series is a $p$-series.}
\choice[correct]{The series is neither a geometric series nor a $p$-series.}
\end{multipleChoice}

Let's think about the other most useful convergence tests.  Which of the following tests are \emph{applicable}?

\begin{selectAll}
\choice[correct]{divergence test}
\choice[correct]{comparison test}
\choice[correct]{limit comparison test}
\choice[correct]{ratio test}
\choice[correct]{root test}
\end{selectAll}

\begin{hint}
The divergence test is always applicable; it has no conditions that are necessary to be applied. For the other tests, there is only one assumption!
\end{hint}

\begin{exercise}
Unfortunately, the divergence test is not conclusive since $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{4+\sin(n)}{n^2} = \answer{0}$.  
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Would the Ratio or Root Test be a good choice to use here?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Since the summand does not contain a term that grows exponentially, the Ratio Test and Root Test will likely be conclusive.}
\choice[correct]{Since the summand does not contain a term that grows exponentially, the Ratio Test and Root Test will likely not be conclusive.}\end{multipleChoice}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Would the Limit Comparison Test be a good choice to use here?  

To answer this, notice that since $\sin(k)$ is bounded,  the summand should ``look like" $\frac{const}{k^2}$.  Let's try setting $b_n = \frac{1}{n^2}$ and consider the limit that results:
\[
L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\answer{ \frac{4+\sin(n)}{n^2}}}{\answer{\frac{1}{n^2}}} =  \lim_{n \to \infty}  \left(\answer{4+\sin(n)}\right)
\]

Since this limit does not exist:

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{The series diverges by limit comparison test.}
\choice{The series converges by limit comparison test.}
\choice[correct]{The limit comparison test is not conclusive.}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
We are left with only one viable option - the Comparison Test.  Note that $\sin(k)$ is bounded, so in essence the summand should ``look like" $\frac{const}{k^2}$.

The series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2}$:

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{is a geometric series with $|r|<1$.  It converges.}
\choice{is a geometric series with $|r|\geq1$.  It diverges.}
\choice[correct]{is a $p$-series with $p>1$.  It converges.}
\choice{is a $p$-series with $p \leq 1$.  It diverges.}
\end{multipleChoice}

Thus, we expect the original series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{4+\sin(k)}{k^2}$ should:

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{converge}
\choice{diverge}
\end{multipleChoice}

Note that this is important because it tells us that in order to use the Comparison Test:
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{We must find a divergent series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k$ for which the terms in the sequence $\{b_n\}_{n=1}$ are larger than $\frac{4+\sin(n)}{n^2}$ for each $n$. }
\choice[correct]{We must find a convergent series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k$ for which the terms in the sequence $\{b_n\}_{n=1}$are larger than $\frac{4+\sin(n)}{n^2}$ for each $n$. }
\choice{We must find a convergent series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k$ for which the terms in the sequence $\{b_n\}_{n=1}$ are smaller than $\frac{4+\sin(n)}{n^2}$ for each $n$. }
\choice{We must find a divergent series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k$ for which the terms in the sequence $\{b_n\}_{n=1}$ are smaller than $\frac{4+\sin(n)}{n^2}$ for each $n$. }
\end{multipleChoice}

\begin{exercise}
We want to use $\frac{1}{n^2}$ to find such a sequence $b_n$.  To do this, we should ask how large $a_n$ can be.  To do this, let's start with the term, $\sin(n)$ that caused trouble earlier.  Note:

\begin{align*}
\sin(n) &\leq 1 \\
4+\sin(n) & \leq 5  \qquad (\textrm{add } 4 \textrm{ to both sides}) \\
\frac{4+\sin(n)}{n^2} & \leq \frac{5}{n^2} \qquad (\textrm{ divide both sides by the positive quantity } n^2) \\
\end{align*}

Now, let $b_n = \frac{5}{n^2}$:  Then, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k$:

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{is a geometric series with $|r|<1$.  It converges.}
\choice{is a geometric series with $|r|\geq1$.  It diverges.}
\choice[correct]{is a $p$-series with $p>1$.  It converges.}
\choice{is a $p$-series with $p \leq 1$.  It diverges.}
\end{multipleChoice}

and we may thus conclude:
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Since $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k$ converges and $b_n \geq a_n$ for all $n$, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ converges by the Comparison Test.}
\choice{Since $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k$ converges and $b_n \geq a_n$ for all $n$, $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ diverges by the Comparison Test.}
\choice{Since $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k$ converges and $b_n \geq a_n$ for all $n$, the Comparison Test is inconclusive.}
\end{multipleChoice}
