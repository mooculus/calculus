\begin{exercise}
Throughout this exercise set, we will adopt the following conventions.

\begin{itemize}
\item It is always possible to define remainders for $\sum_{k=n_0}^{\infty} a_k$ \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{$\sum_{k=n_0}^{\infty} a_k$ converges}\choice{we have a formula for the terms in the sequence of partial sums}\choice{whether $\sum_{k=n_0}^{\infty} a_k$ converges or diverges}} . 
\item For a convergent series $\sum_{k=n_0}^{\infty} a_k$, we have the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item The terms in the sequence of \emph{partial sums} $\{s_n\}_{n=n_0}$ are defined from $s_n = \sum_{k=n_0}^n a_k.$
\item  The terms in the sequence of \emph{remainders} $\{r_n\}_{n=n_0}$ are defined from $r_n = \sum_{k=n+1}^\infty a_k.$
\end{itemize}

Note that if the series $\sum_{k=n_0}^{\infty} a_k$ diverges, then the tail $\sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} a_k$ also diverges, so we cannot assign a value to $r_n$ in this case!

\item This convention lets us split up the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ into an ``approximation plus an error'' in the following sense.

\begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0,0) {
          $ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k=\underbrace{a_1+\ldots +a_n}+ \underbrace{a_{n+1}+ \ldots} = s_n+r_n$};
        \node at (1,-.6) { error};
       
        \node at (-1,-.6) {approximate };
        \node at (-1,-1) {value of the series };
                
      \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  
Notice that the lower index in the sum for $r_n$ always starts at $n+1$ so we can write the series $ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ as $s_n +r_n$.
  
  We do this because we want to approximate the \emph{infinite} series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k$ by the \emph{finite} one $ \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k$.  The remainder term $r_n$ will tell us the error made using this approximation.

\end{itemize}

Finally, you will need to use technology to perform many calculations for this assignment since the topic of remainders is a very computationally practical one.
