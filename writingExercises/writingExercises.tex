\section{Template for exercises}

Exercises are fairly easy to write. All exercises should be in a
directory named ``\verb|exercises|'' that is contained within the
directory for the section to which the exercises pertain. For an
example, see
\link[here]{https://github.com/mooculus/calculus/tree/master/workingInTwoAndThreeDimensions}

The exercises should have outcomes that align with the outcomes from
the section and title page. Authors of exercises should check that
these outcomes align.

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{ximera}

\author{Jane Doe}

\input{../../preamble.tex}

\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}
What is $2+2$? 
\[
2+2 = \answer{4}
\]
\end{exercise}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Keeping track of exercises}

It is important to keep track of all exercises. We do this with
various exercise lists.

In the \verb|exercises| directory, one should make a file
\verb|exerciseList.tex| that lists the exercises. As an example, see \link[this]{https://github.com/mooculus/calculus/blob/master/workingInTwoAndThreeDimensions/exercises/exerciseList.tex}.

Additionally, one should add there exercises to a larger exercise list,
found in the \verb|exercises| directory, at the top-level of the
calculus repository. See \link[this]{https://github.com/mooculus/calculus/tree/master/exercises}.
