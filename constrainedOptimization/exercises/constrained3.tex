\begin{exercise}
  Find the absolute maximum and minimum of $F(x,y) = x^2+2x+y^2+2y$
  constrained to the closed set bounded by the circle $x^2+y^2=4$.
  
  \begin{prompt}
    The critical points within this closed set are (writing
    them in the order of increasing $x$-values):
    \begin{align*}
      \vec{c}_1 &= \vector{\answer{-\sqrt{2}},\answer{-\sqrt{2}}}\\
      \vec{c}_2 &= \vector{\answer{-1},\answer{-1}}\\
      \vec{c}_3 &= \vector{\answer{\sqrt{2}},\answer{\sqrt{2}}}
    \end{align*}
    \begin{exercise}
      The absolute maximum of $F$ when constrained to the closed set is:
      \[
      F\left(\answer{\sqrt{2}},\answer{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \answer{4+4\sqrt{2}}
      \]
      The absolute minimum of $F$ when constrained to the closed set is:
      \[
      F\left(\answer{-1},\answer{-1}\right) = \answer{-2}
    \]
    \end{exercise}
  \end{prompt}
