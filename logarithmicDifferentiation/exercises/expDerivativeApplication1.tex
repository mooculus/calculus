The total number of people who have contracted a common cold by a time $t$ days after its outbreak on an island is given by
\[
N(t) = \frac{200000}{1+100e^{-0.1t}},\quad t\geq0.
\]

The graph of $N$ on the intervall $[0,100]$ is given below.

\begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        xmin=0,xmax=100,ymin=0,ymax=200,
        clip=true,
        unit vector ratio*=4 1 1,
        axis lines=center,
        grid = major,
        ytick={0,20,...,200},
		xtick={0,10,...,100},
    	yticklabels={0,20000,40000,60000,80000,100000,120000,140000,160000,180000,200000},
        xlabel=$t$, ylabel=$N$,
        every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
        every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
      ]
      \addplot[very thick,penColor,domain=0:100,samples=50] plot{200/(1+100*e^(-0.1*x))};
      \end{axis}`
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

$N'(t)$ is increasing on the interval
\[
\left(\answer{0},\answer{50}\right).
\]

The time at which the number of people who have contracted the cold is growing the fastest is
\[
t = \answer{50}.
\]

The rate at which the number of people who have contracted the cold is changing is
\[
N'(t) = \answer{\frac{2000000e^{-0.1t}}{\left(1+100e^{-0.1t}\right)^2}}.
\]

The limit of $N'(t)$ as $t$ goes to $\infty$ is
\[
\lim_{t\to\infty}N'(t) = \answer{0}.
\]

Choose the best interpretation of the limit above.
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{The number of people who have contracted the cold will keep growing in the long run.}
\choice[correct]{The number of people who have contracted the cold will stop growing in the long run.}
\choice{The number of people who have contracted the cold will decrease in the long run.}
\choice{The number of people who have contracted the cold will oscillate in the long run.}
\end{multipleChoice}

The average rate that $N$ changed on the time interval $[5,6]$ rounded to one decimal is
\[
N_{\text{avg}} = \answer{335.1}.
\]

The instantaneous growth rate of $N$ at $t=5$ rounded to one decimal place is
\[
N_{\text{inst}} = \answer{319.1}.
\]

It seems that 
\[
N_{\text{avg}}\approx N_{\text{inst}}.
\]
This can be explained since
\[
N_{\text{inst}} = N'\left(\answer{5}\right) = \lim_{t\to\answer{5}}\frac{N(t)-N(5)}{t-5} \approx \frac{N(6) - N(\answer{5})}{6-\answer{5}} = N_{\text{avg}}.
\]
