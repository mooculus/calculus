\begin{exercise}

Consider 
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}
\]



\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the equation of the secant line connecting the point $(1,f(1))$ to the point $(0.9,f(0.9))$? 
\begin{prompt} 
The equation of this secant line is
$$ y = \answer{ -2.34568x+ 3.34568}$$ 
\end{prompt}

\item  Use the definition of the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line to $f$ at $x=1$, and use this to find the equation of this tangent line.

\begin{prompt} 
The equation of this tangent line is
$$ y = \answer{ -2x + 3}$$ 
\end{prompt}

\end{enumerate}

Isn't it cool how the coefficients in the equation of the secant line are close to those of the tangent line?
