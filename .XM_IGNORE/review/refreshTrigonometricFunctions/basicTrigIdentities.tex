\begin{exercise}
  When working problems involving integrals of products of trigonometric functions, it is necessary to use trigonometric identities to manipulate the expressions in the integrand.
  
  While all of the necessary trigonometric identities will be provided on exams and quizzes, you will need to know how to use them correctly to evaluate antiderivatives involving trigonometric functions.  As such, the following problems will give you some practice.
  
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{I understand.}
    \choice{I do not understand.}
  \end{multipleChoice}

\begin{problem}
  Write the following expression in terms of either sine or cosine:
  \[
    \sec(x) \cot(x) = \answer{\frac{1}{\sin(x)}}
  \]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Use the trigonometric identities to simplify $\frac{\tan(x)}{\sec(x)}$   
  \[
    \frac{\tan(x)}{\sec(x)} = \answer{\sin(x)}
  \]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Combine and simplify the following trigonometric expression:
  \[
    \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} + \frac{1}{\sin^2(x)} = \answer{\csc^2(x)\sec^2(x)}
  \]  
\end{problem}
