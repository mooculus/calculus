\begin{exercise}

  You want to make a cylindrical container to hold 1 liter (1000$\text{cm}^3$) using the
  least amount of construction material.  The side is made from a
  rectangular piece of material, and this can be done with no material
  wasted.  However, the top and bottom are cut from squares of side
  $2r$, so that $2(2r)^2=8r^2$ of material is needed (rather than
  $2\pi r^2$, which is the total area of the top and bottom).  Find
  the dimensions of the container using the least amount of material.
  \begin{hint}
  The total  area of the material spent consists of the area of the lateral side of the cylinder plus the area of two squares of side $2r$.
  
  
  $S= 2\pi r h +8 r^2$

  \begin{hint}
  Use the facts that the volume of the cylinder is $V=r^2\cdot\pi\cdot h$ and that $V=1000$.
  Express $h$ in terms of $r$.
  Now you can express $S$ as a function of $r$.
    \end{hint}
   Our objective function $S$ is given by the expression
   
   
    $S(r)=\frac{\answer{2000}}{r}+8r^{\answer{2}}$.
