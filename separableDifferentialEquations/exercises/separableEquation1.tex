\begin{exercise}
Solve the initial value problem below and explicitly solve for $y$ in your final answer:

\[
x y' +5y =4  , \qquad y(1)=2
\]

The solution is $y(x) = \answer{ \frac{6}{5}x+\frac{4}{5} }$.

\begin{hint}
We first solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to obtain:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \answer{\frac{4-5y}{x}}
\]

Note that we cannot integrate both sides because there is more than one variable on the righthand side.  

Is the equation separable?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{Yes}
\choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}

The differentials $\d y$ and $\d x$ are related by:

\[
\left(\answer{\frac{1}{4-5y}} \right) \d y = \left(\answer{ \frac{1}{x} } \right) \d x
\]

\begin{question}
We can now integrate both sides:

\[
\int \frac{1}{4-5y} \d y =  \int \frac{1}{x} \d x
\]

We compute:

$\int \frac{1}{4-5y} \d y = \answer{-\frac{1}{5}\ln|4-5y|}+C$

$\int \frac{1}{x} \d x = \answer{\ln|x|}+C$

\begin{question}
We thus find that:

\[
-\frac{1}{5} \ln|4-5y|  = \ln|x| + C
\]

Now, we can solve for $|4-5y|$ to find:

\[
|4-5y| = e^{ -5 \ln|x| + C} = e^{-5 \ln|x|} e^{C} 
\]

Note that since $-5C$ is an arbitrary constant, we can simply leave it it $C$.  Also, $e^{C}$ is just a constant, the effect of the $| \cdot |$ can be absorbed into the constant:

\[
4-5y = Ce^{-5 \ln|x|} 
\]

Note that we can treat $e^{-5 \ln|x|}$ two ways:

Using the Laws of Exponents: $e^{-5 \ln|x|} =\left(e^{ \ln|x|}\right)^{-5} = |x|^{-5} = \frac{1}{|x|^5}$

Using the properties of logarithms: $e^{-5 \ln|x|} = e^{\ln \left(|x|^{-5}\right)} = |x|^{-5} = \frac{1}{|x|^5}$

\begin{remark}
This type of algebraic manipulation arises frequently when solving differential equations.  Failing to simplify expressions like this can lead to nightmares when you must perform a subsequent integration step.
\end{remark}

Thus, we have:
\[
4-5y = Ce^{-5 \ln|x|} = C\answer{\frac{1}{|x|^5}}
\]

We can also absorb the effect of the absolute value into our constant of integration and write:

\[
4-5y = \frac{C}{x^5}
\]

 now use the initial condition $y(1) = 2$ to find $C = \answer{-6}$, so the specific solution is:

\[
4-5y = \frac{\answer{-6}}{x^5}
\]

Solving for $y$ gives:

\[
y = \answer{\frac{6}{5x^5}}+\answer{\frac{4}{5}}
\]
