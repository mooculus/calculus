\title[Break-Ground:]{What is area?}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
Two young mathematicians discuss the idea of area.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle

% Introduce Riemann sums as an approximation of antiderivatives

% Think more broadly than area under the curve

% Think about multiplication: we don't just do an "area" or "array" model for multiplication

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, I have a troubling question.
\item[Riley] Yes? 
\item[Devyn] What is area?
\item[Riley] Oh, for a rectangle it is just
  \[
  \text{height}
  \times
  \text{width}
  \]
\item[Devyn] Right. But shouldn't it mean more?
\end{dialogue}

Area is a funny thing. What is it really? Well the idea is this:
\begin{quote}
Define something as having a ``unit'' area, and see how many times it
``covers'' something.
\end{quote}
The most obvious thing to use for our ``unit'' area is a unit
square. From this we can quickly move on to find the area of any
rectangle as
  \[
  \text{height}
  \times
  \text{width}
  \]
\begin{problem}
  Sometimes area is described as ``how much paint will cover a surface.''
  Is this accurate? What do you think?
