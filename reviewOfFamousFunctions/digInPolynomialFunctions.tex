The functions you are most familiar with are probably polynomial
functions.

\section{What are polynomial functions?}

\begin{definition}
  A \dfn{polynomial function} in the variable $x$ is a function
  \emph{which can be written} in the form
  \[
  f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0
  \]
  where the $a_i$'s are all constants (called the \dfn{coefficients})
  and $n$ is a non-negative integer (called the \dfn{degree} when $n\ne
  0$). The domain of a polynomial function is $(-\infty,\infty)$.
\end{definition}

This means the function $f(x)=x$ is a polynomial of degree $1$, with $a_1 = 1$ and $a_0 = 0$. The function $g(x) = 2$ is a polynomial with $n=0$ and $a_0 = 2$. Similarly, any constant function is a polynomial function. However, $h(x) = \sqrt[3]{x} = x^{1/3}$ is not a polynomial since the exponent $1/3$ is not a whole number.
	
\begin{question}
  Which of the following are polynomial functions?
  \begin{selectAll}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = 0$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = -9$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = 3x+1$}
    \choice{$f(x) = x^{1/2}-x +8$}
    \choice{$f(x) = -4x^{-3}+5x^{-1}+7-18x^2$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = (x+1)(x-1)+e^x - e^x $}
    \choice{$f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 3x + 2}{x-2}$}
    \choice[correct]{$f(x) = x^7-32x^6-\pi x^3+45/84$}
  \end{selectAll}
\end{question}

The phrase above ``in the variable $x$'' can actually change.
\[
y^2-4y +1
\]
is a polynomial in $y$, and
\[
\sin^2(x) + \sin(x) -3 
\]
is a polynomial in $\sin(x)$.


\section{What can the graphs look like?}

Fun fact:

\begin{theorem}[The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]\index{Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}
  Every polynomial of the form
  \[
  a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0
  \]
  where the $a_i$'s are real (or even complex!) numbers and $a_n \ne 0$ has exactly
  $n$ (possibly repeated) complex roots.
\end{theorem}

Remember, a \dfn{root} is where a polynomial is zero. The theorem
above is a deep fact of mathematics. The great mathematician Gauss
%(spelled Gau\ss\ for fancy people)
proved the theorem in 1799 for his doctoral thesis. 

The upshot as far as we are concerned is that when we plot a
polynomial of degree $n$, its graph will cross the $x$-axis \emph{at most}
$n$ times. Each crossing corresponds to a real root of that polynomial.  (Complex roots do not give crossings!)

\begin{example}
	Sketch a rough graph of the function $f(x) = 2(x-1)^2(x+2)$.

	\begin{explanation}
		We are given $f$ in factored form, so we recognize that $x=1$ is a zero of multiplicity $2$, and $x=-2$ is a zero of multiplicity $1$.
		That means our graph will have $x$-intercepts at those locations.
		
		At these $x$-intercepts, will the graph pass through the $x$-axis like a line does, or will it touch the axis and turn back
		around, like a parabola does at it's vertex?  To answer this, look at a sign-chart for $f$.

		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture} 
			\tkzTabInit[lgt=2,espcl=1] 
				{$x$         /1, 
				$2$   /1, 
				$\left(x-1\right)^2$  /1,
				$x+2$       /1}% 
				{  , $-2$ , $1$ ,  }% 
			\tkzTabLine{ , + , t , + , t , + , }
			\tkzTabLine{ , + , t , + , t , + ,}
			\tkzTabLine{ , - , t , + , t , + ,  }
		\end{tikzpicture} 
		\end{center}
		
		Notice that around $x=-2$, only the $x+2$ factor changes signs.  That means $f(x)$ will change signs, so the graph will pass through the $x$-axis at $x=-2$.
		At $x=1$, however, the $(x-1)^2$ factor does NOT change signs (due to the even exponent).  That means $f(x)$ will turn around at that $x$-intercept.  
		We also notice that for $x$ in the interval $(-\infty, -2)$ the function $f$ is negative and for $x$ in $(1,\infty)$ the function $f$ is positive.
		(Since $f$ is an odd-degree polynomial, its `ends' go in opposite directions.) Putting this together, we have the following graph.
		
		\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
        			\begin{axis}[
          			domain=-3:3,
          			xmin=-3, xmax=3,
          			ymin=-2, ymax=9,
          			width=3in,
          			axis lines =middle, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
          			every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
          			every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
          			]
	 	 		\addplot [very thick, penColor, smooth] {2*((x-1)^2)*(x+2)};
        			\end{axis}
      		\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{center}
	\end{explanation}
\end{example}

  For each of the curves, determine if the polynomial has
  \textbf{even} or \textbf{odd} degree, and if the leading coefficient
  (the one next to the highest power of $x$) of the polynomial is
  \textbf{positive} or \textbf{negative}.
  \begin{explanation}\hfil
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Curve $A$ is defined by an
      \wordChoice{\choice{even}\choice[correct]{odd}} degree
      polynomial with a \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive}\choice{negative}}
      leading term.
    \item Curve $B$ is defined by an

      polynomial with a

%% \section{Connections to inverse functions}

%% Polynomials only have inverse functions if they are
%% one-to-one. Pratically this means that polynomials of \textit{even}
%% degree are \textit{never} invertible since they are never
%% one-to-one. Odd degree polynomials may or may not be invertible. This
%% is worth repeating in the language of algebra, and we will write it as
%% a warning.

%% \begin{warning}
%%   Consider $f(x) = x^2$. Suppose we tried to find the inverse of
%%   $x^2$. In this case we plug $f^{-1}(x)$ into $f$ and write
%%   \begin{align*}
%%     f(f^{-1}(x)) &= \left(f^{-1}(x)\right)^2\\
%%     x &= \left(f^{-1}(x)\right)^2
%%   \end{align*}
%% at this point you may be tempted to say ``$f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}$'' but
%% this is not correct. The correct next line is:
%% \[
%% f^{-1}(x) = \pm \sqrt{x},
%% \]
%% but this \textbf{is not a function} from the real numbers to the real
%% numbers.
%% \end{warning}
