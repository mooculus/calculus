\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item View the chain rule in terms of the gradient.
\item Compute the derivative of the compostion of a function of
  several variables with a vector-valued function.
\item Use the chain rule of several variables to implicitly
  differentiate a curve.
\end{itemize}
