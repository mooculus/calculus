\begin{exercise}
  We measure the radius of a disk as $4 \textrm{ m}$.  However, our
  ruler is only allows us an accuracy of $\pm 1 \textrm{ cm}$.  Use
  differentials to estimate the potential error in the area which
  results from this potential error in measurement.

\begin{prompt}
  The potential error is $\pm \answer{2*\pi*4*0.01} \textrm{ m}^2$
\end{prompt}
