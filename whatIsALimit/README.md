# What is a limit?

This section needs to be written.


\begin{definition}[Informal]
Intuitively, the \textbf{limit} of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$, written 
\[
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L,
\]
if the value of $f(x)$ can be made as close as one wishes to $L$ for all $x$ sufficiently
close, but not equal to, $a$.
\end{definition}

## Misconceptions

* Dynamic view: Finding a limit tells you how a function "moves"
* Limits are approximations
* Limits are "un-reachable"
* Limits are a "barrier"
* Near vs "nearer and nearer"
* The very word "limit"
