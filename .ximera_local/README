Ximera, pronounced "chimera," (Ximera: Interactive, Mathematics,
Education, Resources, for All) is an open-source platform that
provides tools for authoring and publishing (PDF and Online),
open-source, interactive educational content, such as textbooks,
assessments, and online courses.

The Ximera document class is designed to support all syntax used to
create interactive online content. This means that by default, we try
to display all authoring content. This includes links to online
interactives, notifications when something differs in the PDF vs the
online incarnation. By using various options in the documentclass,
notably `handout` reasonable PDF handouts and full books can be
created along side the document class.

While one can produce high-quality PDF using Ximera, authors need to
decide exactly how Ximera documents fit-in to their work and use them
consistently.

Please reach out to the developers with any questions.
