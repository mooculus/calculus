\maketitle

Our goal is to provide a text that students will read.

Each chapter consists of three distinct parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item A title page with learning outcomes listed.
\item A ``Break-Ground'' where we find a hypothetical dialogue between
  two students. This section is designed to create an ``intellectual
  need'' for the content that will be discussed later in the chapter.
\item One or more ``Dig-In'' sections that contain the content of the
  section.
\end{itemize}


\end{document}
