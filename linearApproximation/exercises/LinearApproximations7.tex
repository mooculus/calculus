The total number of people $N$ who have contracted a common cold by a time $t$ days after its outbreak on an island is given by
\[
N(t) = \frac{200000}{1+100e^{-0.1t}},\,t\geq0.
\]

We can express the relationship between a small change in $t$ and the corresponding change in $N$ in the form $\d{N} = N'(t)\d{t}$ giving us
\[
\d{N} = \frac{\answer{2000000}e^{-0.1t}}{\left(1+100e^{-0.1t}\right)^2}\d{t}.
\]

Assuming that 45 days have passed since the outbreak started, we use the above formula to estimate the number of people (rounded to the nearest 1 person) that will fall sick in the next day. That number is approximately $\answer{4986}$.

Assuming that 100 days have passed since the outbreak started, we use the above formula to estimate the number of people (rounded to the nearest 1 person) that will fall sick in the next day. That number is approximately $\answer{90}$.
