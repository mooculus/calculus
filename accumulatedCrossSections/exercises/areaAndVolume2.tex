The region $R$ is bounded by $y=3-x^2$ and $y=x+1$. 





\begin{exercise}
By integrating with respect to $y$, how many integrals are needed to express the area of $R$? $\answer{2}$

\begin{exercise}
The area of the region can be found by evaluating:

\[
	A = \int_1^{\answer{2}} \answer{y-1+\sqrt{3-y}} \d y  +\int_{\answer{2}}^{\answer{3}} \answer{2\sqrt{3-y}} \d y 
\]
	
\end{exercise}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
The base of a certain solid is the region $R$.  Cross sections through the solid taken parallel to the $y$-axis are semicircles. 


To express the volume of a solid using a definite integral, we should:
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct]{integrate with respect to $x$.}
\choice{integrate with respect to $y$.}
\end{multipleChoice}

An integral that expresses the volume of the solid is:

\[
	V= \int_{x=\answer{-2}}^{x=\answer{1}}\answer{\frac{\pi}{8}(2-x-x^2)^2} \d x
\]
		
		



\end{exercise}
