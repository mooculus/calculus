\begin{exercise}

Calculate the value of $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k^3}{3+5k^5}$ to within $.001$ of its exact value.  Use technology to perform all necessary computations.

To within $.001$, we find that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}  \frac{k^3}{3+5k^5} \approx \answer[tolerance=.001]{.253}$
\begin{hint}
This would be a nasty integral to compute.  However, the point of this exercise is to use technology, so take advantage of it!  By using technology, we can evaluate $\int_N^{\infty} \frac{x^3}{3+5x^5} \d x$ for different choice on $N$.  Once you find an $N$-value large enough so $\int_N^{\infty} \frac{x^3}{3+5x^5} \d x \leq .001$, you can compute $\sum_{k=1}^{N} \frac{k^3}{3+5k^5}$ for that value of $N$ (by using technology), and this will be the desired approximation!
