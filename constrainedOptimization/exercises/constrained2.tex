\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}
  Find the absolute maximum and minimum of $F(x,y) = 5x-7y$ constrained to the closed set bounded by $y=x^2$ and $y=1$.
  
  \begin{prompt}
    How many critical points are there in this closed set?
    \[
    \answer{1}
    \]
    \begin{exercise}
      This critical point is at:
      \[
      \vec{c} = \vector{\answer{5/14},\answer{25/196}}
      \]
    \end{exercise}
    \begin{exercise}
    \begin{hint}
      Remember to check the corners.
    \end{hint}
    The absolute maximum of $F$ when constrained to the closed set is:
    \[
    F\left(\answer{5/14},\answer{25/196}\right) = \answer{25/28}
    \]
    The absolute minimum of $F$ when constrained to the closed set is:
    \[
    F\left(\answer{-1},\answer{1}\right) = \answer{-12}
    \]
  \end{exercise}
  \end{prompt}
