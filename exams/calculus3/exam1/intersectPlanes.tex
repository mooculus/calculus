\begin{problem}
  Suppose I have two planes $L$ and $M$ with the point $(1,2,3)$ on
  their intersection. Plane $L$ has a normal vector $\vector{1,-2,0}$
  and plane $M$ has an implicit formula $3x-4y+z=-2$.  Find a
  vector-valued formula for the line that lies on the intersection of
  the planes $L$ and $M$.

  \begin{prompt}
    \[
    \vecl(t) = \vector{1-2t,\answer{2-t},\answer{3+2t}}
    \]
  \end{prompt}

\textbf{For problems 17--18,} suppose someone throws a calculus book
across the room.

\begin{problem}
  Assuming that the acceleration due to gravity is $\vec{g} =
  \vector{0,-10\unit{m}/\unit{s}^2}$, and that the calculus book is
  thrown at an angle of $\pi/4$ radians at an initial velocity of
  $5\unit{m}/{s}$, find a vector-valued function describing the
  \textbf{velocity} of the book.
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
    \vec{v}(t)=\vector{\answer{\frac{5}{\sqrt{2}}}, \answer{\frac{5}{\sqrt{2}}-10t}}
    \]
  \end{prompt}

\begin{problem}
  Supposing that the initial position of the book is $1\unit{m}$ above
  the ground, find a vector-valued formula for the \textbf{position} of the book.
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
    \vec{p}(t)=\vector{\answer{\frac{5t}{\sqrt{2}}}, \answer{1+ \frac{5t}{\sqrt{2}}-5t^2}}
    \]
