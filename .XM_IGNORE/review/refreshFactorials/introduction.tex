\begin{exercise}
The Ratio Test is a useful convergence test that is very useful when trying to determine convergence or divergence of series whose summands involve products of polynomials, factorials, and exponential functions. A fundamental skill when using this test is to be able to simplify ratios of expressions involving these types of terms.  This assignment will give practice simplifying these types of expressions.
