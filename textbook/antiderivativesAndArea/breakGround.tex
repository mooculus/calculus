\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Hey Riley, I was reading about the history of mathematics.
\item[Riley] Really? Tell me about it!
\item[Devyn] Apparently, back in the day, mathematicians worried about writing things like:
  \[
  3\times 4 + 5
  \]
\item[Riley] Why? What's the matter here?
\item[Devyn] Well, they thought of $3\times 4$ as an
  \textbf{area}. But $5$ was thought of as a \textbf{length}. Apparently they worried whether it made sense to add ``areas'' and ``lengths.''
\item[Riley] Hmmm. We don't seem to worry about that now. I wonder why?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{problem}
  What are some ways to interpret $3\times 4$?
  \begin{freeResponse}
    Answer will vary.
  \end{freeResponse}
