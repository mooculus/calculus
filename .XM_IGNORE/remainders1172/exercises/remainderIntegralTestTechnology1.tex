\begin{exercise}

Calculate the value of $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^{4/3}}$ to within $.0001$ of its exact value.  Use technology to perform all necessary computations.

%N=1000

To within $.0001$, we find that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}  \frac{1}{k^{4/3}} \approx \answer[tolerance=.00006]{3.60094}$
\begin{hint}
This integral isn't too bad to compute.  However, the point of this exercise is to use technology, so take advantage of it!  By using technology to solve $\int_N^{N+1} \frac{1}{x^{4/3}} \d x =.0001$, we find that $N = \answer{1000}$ (remember to round up).  The error estimates can now be used to find a range of possible values for the series.
