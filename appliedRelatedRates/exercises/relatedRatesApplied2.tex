\begin{exercise}



A colony of bacteria are growing on a petri dish.  They form a
circular disk, which appears to be growing at a rate of $4$ square
millimeters per hour.  When the radius of the disk is $3$ millimeters,
at what rate is the radius growing?


\begin{prompt}
  At this instant, the radius of this disk is growing at a rate
  of $\answer{\frac{2}{3\pi}}$ millimeters per hour.
\end{prompt}
