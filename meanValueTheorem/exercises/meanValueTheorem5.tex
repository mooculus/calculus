The position of an object moving along a horizontal line is given by $s(t)$, where $t$ is measured in seconds, and $s$ in meters .

Below is a partial table of values of $s(t)$.


\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
t & 0 & 1 & 3 & 4\\\hline
s(t) & 0 & 50 & 75 & 80\\\hline
\end{array} 
\]


\begin{exercise}
Compute the average velocity of the object during the time interval $[0,4]$.



The average velocity of the object during the time interval $[0,4]$ is $\answer{20}$ m/s.

\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
Suppose that the function $s$ is continuous on $[0,10]$ and differentiable on $(0,10)$.

 Then  on the interval $[0,4]$ the function $s$ \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{satisfies}\choice{does not satisfy}} the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem
 
  so \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{there exists}\choice{there does not necessarily exist}} a number c in the interval $(0,4)$ 
  
  such that $s'(c)$ equals the above calculated average velocity.
  

This means that at the time $t=c$ the \textbf{instantaneous velocity} of the object is equal to the \textbf{average velocity} of the object during the time interval $[0,4]$.
