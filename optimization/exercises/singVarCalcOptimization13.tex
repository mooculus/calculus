  A window is to be built in the shape of a semi-circle over a rectangle:
  \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[very thick,penColor] (2,0) arc (0:180:2 and 2);% top half of ellipse
      \draw[penColor, very thick] (-2,-2) -- (2,-2);
      \draw[penColor, very thick] (2,-2) -- (2,0);
      \draw[penColor,very thick] (-2,-2) -- (-2,0);
      \draw[penColor,very thick,dashed] (-2,0) -- (2,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
  If the outer perimeter is $10$ feet, maximize the area. Round your answer to the closest tenth of a square foot.
  \begin{hint}
  Let's label the picture.
   \begin{image}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[very thick,penColor] (2,0) arc (0:180:2 and 2);% top half of ellipse
      \draw[penColor, very thick] (-2,-2) -- (2,-2);
        \draw[penColor2, very thick, dashed] (0,0) -- (0,2);
      \draw[penColor, very thick] (2,-2) -- (2,0);
      \draw[penColor,very thick] (-2,-2) -- (-2,0);
      \draw[penColor,very thick,dashed] (-2,0) -- (2,0);
        \node [below,penColor] at (1,0.35) {$r$};
         \node [below,penColor] at (0.2,1.2) {$r$};
          \node [below,penColor] at (0,-1.6) {$2r$};
           \node [below,penColor] at (-1.7,-0.7) {$x$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{image}
    \end{hint}
      \begin{hint}
      The outer perimeter, $P$, is given by
      
      $P=2r+2x+r\pi$.
      
      Since we know that $P=10$, we can express $x$ in terms of $r$.
      
      $x=5-r\frac{\pi}{2}-r$.
      
      The area, A , consists of the area of the rectangle + the area of the semicircle:
      
      $A= 2\cdot r\cdot x+\frac{\pi}{2} r^2$
      
        \end{hint}
           \begin{hint}
           We can now express the area  $A$ as a function of $r$:
           
           $A(r)=2\cdot r\cdot (5-r\frac{\pi}{2}-r)+\frac{\pi}{2} r^2=10r-\frac{\pi}{2}r^2-2r^2$.
           
           The domain of A is  the closed interval $\left[0,\frac{10}{2+\pi}\right]$.(Remember: P=10!)
              \end{hint}
                \begin{hint}
                Now we have to find the global maximum of $A$ on its domain.
                First, we have to find the critical points of $A$.
                Since
                
                $A'(r)=10-\pi r-4r$,
                
                it follows that the function $A$ has its only critical point at  $r=\frac{\answer{10}}{4+\pi}$ .
                              \end{hint}
                                \begin{hint}
                                Now, we evaluate $A$ at the end points and at the critical point and then compare the values.
                                
                                $A(0)=0$
                                
                                $A\left(\frac{10}{2+\pi}\right)=\frac{50\pi}{(2+\pi)^2}$
                                
                                $A\left(\frac{\answer{10}}{4+\pi}\right)=\frac{\answer{200+350\pi}}{(4+\pi)^2}\approx 7$
                                
                                This seems complicated. It is better to argue that the derivative 
                                
                                $A'(r)>0$ on $\left(0,\frac{10}{4+\pi}\right)$ and  $A'(r)<0$ on $\left(\frac{10}{4+\pi},\frac{10}{2+\pi}\right)$,
                                
                                 since $A'(r)=10-\pi r-4r=10-r(\pi+4)=-(\pi+4)\left(r-\frac{10}{\pi+4}\right)$.
                                 
                                 
                                 This implies that the global maximum occurs at the critical point.
