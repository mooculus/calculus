\begin{exercise}

This exercise demonstrates several common mistakes that students can make. In each exercise, examine the student's work closely to find any errors in their reasoning or calculations.

\begin{problem}
  A student claims that $\int \frac{1}{1-x^2} \d x = \ln(1 - x^2) + C$.
  Determine if the student is correct.
  If the student is incorrect, choose the best explanation that follows.
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The student is correct.}
    \choice[correct]{The student is incorrect.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{problem}
    If the student's claim had been correct, then
    \[
    \dd{x} \ln(1 - x^2) = \answer{\frac{1}{1-x^2}}.
    \]
    However,
    \[
    \dd{x} \ln(1 - x^2) = \answer{\frac{-2x}{1 - x^2}}
    \]
  \end{problem}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
  A student is asked to compute $\int x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \d x$ on a midterm and provides the following solution:
  \[
    \int x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \d x= \int x(1 -x) \d x = \int (x - x^2 )\d x = \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C.
  \]
  Determine if the student is correct.
  If the student is not correct, choose the most appropriate response below.
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The student is correct.}
    \choice[correct]{The student is incorrect.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{problem}
    The mistake was in asserting that $\sqrt{1 - x^2} \ne 1 - x$.  To
    compute this antiderivative, the student should perform a
    $u$-substitution with $u = \answer{1 - x^2}$.  Upon making this
    substitution, the correct antiderivative of $y = x \sqrt{1 - x^2}$
    is $\answer{(-1/3)(1 - x^2)^{3/2}} + C$.
  \end{problem}
\end{problem}



\begin{problem}
  A student is asked to compute $\int 3x^2 \cos(x) \d x$ on a midterm and provides the following solution:
  \[
    \int 3x^2 \cos(x) \d x = x^3 \sin(x) + C.
  \]
  Determine if the student is correct.
  If the student is not correct, choose the most appropriate response below.
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The student is correct}
    \choice{The student is incorrect; $\int 3x^2 \cos(x) \d x = -x^3 \sin(x) + C$.}
    \choice[correct]{The student is incorrect.}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{problem}
    The mistake was in attempting to split the integral over the
    product.  If the student were correct, then using the definition
    of the antiderivative, $\dd{x}(x^3\sin(x) + C) = 3x^2 \cos(x)$.
    However,
    \[
    \dd{x}(x^3 \sin(x) + C) = \answer{3x^2 \sin(x) + x^3 \cos(x)}
    \]
  \end{problem}
  \begin{hint}
    To verify an antiderivative, differentiate and compare.
  \end{hint}
\end{problem}
