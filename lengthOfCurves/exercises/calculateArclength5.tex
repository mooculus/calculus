\outcome{Set up an integral that gives the length of a curve segment and evaluate it}

\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}

The graph of $x^2+y^2=r^2$ is a circle of radius $r$ centered at the origin.  From geometry, we know that the circumference of this circle is $\answer{2 \pi r}$ (type your answer in terms of $r$)

\begin{exercise}
We can set up an integral with respect to $x$ or $y$ that verifies this result.  First, we notice that the circumference of the circle is $\answer{4}$ times the circumference of the part of the circle in the first quadrant.

In the first quadrant, we can express the circle as a function of $x$ by $y=\answer{\sqrt{r^2-x^2}}$.

\begin{exercise}
Computing the derivative:

\[
\frac{\d y}{\d x} = -\frac{x}{\sqrt{r^2-x^2}}
\]

\begin{exercise}

After some algebra, we find:

\[
1+ \left(\frac{\d y}{\d x} \right)^2 = \frac{r^2}{r^2-x^2}
\]

\begin{hint}
First, find $\left(\frac{\d y}{\d x} \right)^2$ and simplify it.  Then, find a common denominator and add the fractions.
\end{hint}

\begin{exercise}

The integral with respect to $x$ that gives the length of the curve \emph{in the first quadrant} is:

\[
s= \int_{x=\answer{0}}^{x=\answer{r}} \answer{\frac{r}{\sqrt{r^2-x^2}}} \d x
\]

\begin{exercise}
Referring to a table, if necessary, $\int \frac{r}{\sqrt{r^2-x^2}}dx = \answer{r \arcsin(x/r)}$+C.  Thus,

\[
s= \eval{\answer{r \arcsin(x/r)}}_0^r
\]

Evaluating this gives that the length of the portion of the curve in the first quadrant is $\answer{\frac{\pi}{2}r}$ units. (type your answer in terms of $r$)

\begin{exercise}
Thus, the circumference of the circle is $\answer{2 \pi r}$ units. (type your answer in terms of $r$)
