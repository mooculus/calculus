\begin{exercise}

A culture of cells has an initial population of 200 at $t=0$.  The growth rate of the cells is given by
\[
P'(t) = 60e^{-0.2t}
\]
where $P'(t)$ is measured in cells per hour.

The  number of cells after 2 hours is
\[
P(2) = \answer{299} \text{round to a whole number}
\]

For $t\geq0$ the number of cells is given by
\[
P(t) = \answer{500 - 300e^{-0.2t}}.
\]

The limiting population of the culture is
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty} P(t) = \answer{500}.
\]

We see then that the culture \wordChoice{\choice{grows without bound}\choice[correct]{levels off at a finite, nonzero population}\choice{dies off in the long run}}.
