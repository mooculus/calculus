The integration technique of partial fractions is a useful technique
when evaluating antiderivatives of rational expressions when the
degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.

In order to use this technique, it is important to be able to
perform polynomial long division when the degree of the numerator is
greater than the degree of the denominator.

Here is a reminder of the procedure.

\begin{itemize}
\item[Step 1:] Make sure the polynomial is written in descending order.  Fill in a $0$ if there is a ``missing'' power of $x$.
\item[Step 2:] Divide the term with the highest power inside the division symbol by the term with the highest power outside the division symbol.
\item[Step 3:] Multiply the answer obtained in the previous step by the polynomial in front of the division symbol.
\item[Step 4:] Subtract and bring down the next term.
\item[Step 5:] Repeat Steps 2, 3, and 4 until there are no more terms to bring down.
\item[Step 6:] The term remaining after the last subtract step is the remainder and must be written as a fraction, whose denominator is the divisor, in the final answer.
\end{itemize}

For some worked examples, please use the link at the end of the  \link[problem.]{http://www.mesacc.edu/~scotz47781/mat120/notes/divide_poly/long_division/long_division.html}.  Once you feel comfortable, use polynomial long division to answer the following questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item $\frac{2x+3}{x+1} = \answer{2}+\frac{\answer{1}}{x+1}$
\item $\frac{2x^3-5x^2+5x+5}{2x+1} = \answer{x^2-3x+4}+\frac{\answer{1}}{2x+1}$.
\item $\frac{2x^4+x-8}{x^2+2}=\answer{2x^2-4}+\frac{\answer{x}}{x^2+2}$.
\end{itemize}
