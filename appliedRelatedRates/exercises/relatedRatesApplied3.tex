\begin{exercise}
  Two row boats start at the same location, and start traveling apart
  along straight lines at an angle of $\frac{\pi}{3}$.


  Boat $A$ is traveling at a rate of $5$ miles per hour directly east,
  and boat $B$ is traveling at a rate of $10$ miles per hour going
  northeast.

  How fast is the distance between the rowboats increasing $3$ hours
  into the journey?
  \begin{hint}
  Draw a 30/60/90 triangle and note that one boat is going twice as fast as the other.
  \end{hint}

\begin{prompt}
  The rowboats are diverging from each other at a rate of
  $\answer{\frac{225}{\sqrt{675}}}$ miles each hour.
\end{prompt}
