%\outcome{Find tangent lines to parametric curves}
\author{Jim Talamo}

\begin{document}
\begin{exercise}

Suppose that a curve $C$ is defined by the parametric equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
x(t) &= t^2+4t-2 \\
y(t) &= t^3-3t+1
\end{cases} , \textrm{ for } -\infty < t < \infty
\]

Find the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $t$.

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\answer{3t^2-3}}{\answer{2t+4}}
\]

\begin{hint}
Using the chain rule allows us to write $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}$.
\end{hint}

%%%Horizontal Tangent Lines%%%%%%
\begin{exercise}
We can find the horizontal tangent lines by examining when the the derivative is $0$.

How many horizontal tangent lines does the curve $C$ have?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$0$}
\choice{$1$}
\choice[correct]{$2$}
\choice{$3$}
\end{multipleChoice}

The horizontal tangent lines occur when $t=\answer{-1}$ and $t=\answer{1}$

(type the smaller $t$-value first)

\begin{exercise}
When $t=-1$, the horizontal tangent line is $y=\answer{3}$ and occurs at the point $(x,y) = \left(\answer{-5},\answer{3}\right)$.

When $t=1$, the horizontal tangent line is $y=\answer{-1}$ and occurs at the point $(x,y) = \left(\answer{3},\answer{-1}\right)$.

\begin{exercise}
You should check your work with Desmos.  Follow the instructions in the previous exercise to sketch the curve, then type your answers above into a new line on the same Desmos worksheet to see if they are indeed the desired tangent lines to the curve.
\end{exercise}

\end{exercise}
\end{exercise}

%%%vertical Tangent Lines%%%%%%
\begin{exercise}
We can find the vertical tangent lines by examining when the the derivative becomes infinite.

How many vertical tangent lines does the curve $C$ have?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{$0$}
\choice[correct]{$1$}
\choice{$2$}
\choice{$3$}
\end{multipleChoice}

The vertical tangent line occurs when $t=\answer{-2}$.

When $t=-2$, the vertical tangent line is $x=\answer{-6}$ and occurs at the point $(x,y) = \left(\answer{-6},\answer{-1}\right)$.

\begin{exercise}
You should check your work with Desmos.  Follow the instructions in the previous exercise to sketch the curve, then type your answers above into a new line on the same Desmos worksheet to see if they are indeed the desired tangent lines to the curve.
\end{exercise}

\end{exercise}

%%%Line with a given t%%%%
\begin{exercise}
Find the equation of the tangent line to $C$ when $t = 2$.  Express your final answer in the form $y=mx+b$.

The tangent line is:

\[
y = \answer{\frac{9}{8}}x+\answer{-\frac{33}{4}}
\]

\begin{hint}
To find the slope, we evaluate $\frac{dy}{dx}$ when $t=2$ to find:

\[
m_{tan} = \answer{\frac{9}{8}}
\]

A point on the curve is $(x(t),y(t))$ when $t=\answer{2}$.  We find:

$x(2) = \answer{10}$

$y(2) = \answer{3}$

We can use point-slope form to find:

\begin{align*}
y-y(2) &= m_{tan}(x-x(2)) \\
y- \answer{3} &= \answer{\frac{9}{8}} \left( x-\answer{10} \right)
\end{align*}

Now solve for $y$.
