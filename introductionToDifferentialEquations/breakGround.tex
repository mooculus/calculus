% Misconception: difference between equation versus function

% Find solutions to functional equations

% I'm thinking of a function whose derivative is three times that function.

% It must be zero!

% Well that wasn't what I was thinking of.

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley, check out this book, it has some cool applications
  of calculus:
\begin{quote}
  The following differential equation can be used to model the spread
  of an infectious disease:
  \[
  \mathrm{infect}'(t) = k\cdot \mathrm{infect}(t)\cdot (P-\mathrm{infect}(t))
  \]
  where $k$ is a constant, $\mathrm{infect}(t)$ is the number of people
  infected by the disease on day $t$, and $P$ is the size of the
  population vulnerable to the disease.
\end{quote}
\item[Riley] Whoa. That's like a formula for a derivative. Wow. Much calculus. 
\item[Devyn] I wonder how you solve equations like this?
\item[Riley] I wonder if we can sometimes just use facts about the
  derivative to give us an approximation for the function that models the spread of infection?
\end{dialogue}



\begin{problem}
  Suppose your calculus class has had a freak outbreak of the
  \textit{math-philia}. Some facts: We have around $200$ students in
  our class, we are now on the $23$rd day of the outbreak, and currently $100$ students are infected. Using the differential
  equation
  \[
  \mathrm{infect}'(t) = k\cdot \mathrm{infect}(t)\cdot (P-\mathrm{infect}(t))
  \]
  we can model the spread of \textit{math-philia} by setting $k=0.001$.
  What is $\mathrm{infect}'(23)$?
  \begin{prompt}
    \[
    \mathrm{infect}'(23) = \answer{10}
    \]
  \end{prompt}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Do your best to explain why the equation
  \[
  \mathrm{infect}'(t) = k\cdot \mathrm{infect}(t)\cdot (P-\mathrm{infect}(t))
  \]
  is reasonable.
  \begin{hint}
    Don't worry, just do your best.
  \end{hint}
