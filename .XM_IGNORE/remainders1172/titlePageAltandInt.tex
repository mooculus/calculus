\item Approximate the value of a series that converges by the alternating series test.
\item Approximate the value of a series that converges by the integral test.
\item Estimate the value of a convergent series by a term in the sequence of partial sums.
\item Understand when a better approximation can be produced by using the sequence of partial sums and error bounds.
\end{itemize}
