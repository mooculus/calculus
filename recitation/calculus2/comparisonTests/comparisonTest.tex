\section{Discussion Questions}

\begin{problem}
Let $\{a_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ and $\{b_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ be sequences of positive numbers. Determine whether the following statements are true or false and justify your answer.

I. If $a_k \leq b_k$ for sufficiently large $k$ and if the series $\sum b_k$ converges, then the series $\sum a_k$ must also converge.

II. If $a_k \leq b_k$ for sufficiently large $k$ and the series $\sum a_k$ converges, then the series $\sum b_k$ must also converge. 

III. If $\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k}$ is finite and the series $\sum a_k$ diverges, then the series $\sum b_k$ must also diverge.

IV. If the series $\sum a_k$ converges and the series $\sum b_k$ diverges, then the limit $\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k}$ either does not exist or is infinite. 

\begin{freeResponse}
I. This statement is true, by the Comparison Test.

II. This statement is false; for example, let $b_k = 1$ for all $k$ and let $a_k = 1/k^2$. 

III. This statement is true, by the Comparison Test.

IV. This statement is false. For example, let $a_k = 1/k^2$ and let $b_k = 1/k$. Then $\sum a_k$ converges, $\sum b_k$ diverges, and
$$
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k} = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1/k^2}{1/k} = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{k} = 0
$$
is finite. A correct statement is ``If the series $\sum a_k$ converges and the series $\sum b_k$ diverges, then the limit $\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k}$ either does not exist or is zero or infinity."
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider the following statement: 

If $\{a_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ and $\{b_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ are sequences of positive numbers such that $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} a_k = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} b_k$, then the series 
$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k \;\; \mbox{ and } \;\; \sum_{k=1}^\infty b_k
$$
either both converge or they both diverge. 

Determine whether the following proof of this statement is valid:

Assume that $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} a_k = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} b_k$. Then
$$
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k} = \frac{\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} a_k}{\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} b_k} = 1.
$$
Since this limit is finite, it follows by the ratio test that the series $\sum a_k$ and $\sum b_k$ both converge or both diverge. 

\begin{freeResponse}
The ``proof" of the statement is not valid; if the limits $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} a_k = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} b_k$ are equal to zero, then the division step in the proof is not justified. In fact, there is no valid proof of the statement, because the statement is false. A simple counterexample is given by the sequences defined by $a_k = 1/k$ and $b_k = 1/k^2$. 
\end{freeResponse}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
Let $\{a_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ and $\{b_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ be sequences of positive numbers and suppose that the series $\sum b_k$ converges. Which of the following conditions would allow us to conclude that the series $\sum a_k$ converges?

I. For sufficiently large $k$, $b_k \leq a_k$. 

II. For sufficiently large $k$, $a_k \leq b_k$.

III. $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{b_k}{a_k} = 0$.

IV. The series $\sum \frac{a_k}{b_k}$ converges. 

\begin{freeResponse}
Statement II. would guarantee the convergence of $\sum a_k$, by the Comparison Test. Statement IV. would also imply the convergence of $\sum a_k$, since the convergence of $\sum \frac{a_k}{b_k}$ implies that $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k} = 0$, and the claim follows by the Limit Comparison Test.


Statements I. and III. do not imply the convergence of $\sum a_k$. To see that Statement I. is not sufficient, note that if $a_k = 1$ for all $k$, then $b_k \leq a_k$ will hold for sufficiently large $k$ for any sequence of terms $\{b_k\}$ such that $\sum b_k$ converges. A counterexample to the sufficiency of Statement III. is given by $b_k = 1/k^2$ and $a_k = 1/k$.

\begin{problem}
Determine which test(s) would be useful to deduce whether each of the following series converges or diverges.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
I. $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{8k^2-3k}{7k^2+k^4+10}$ \hspace{.2in} & II. $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{5^{k+1}}{k!}$ \hspace{.2in} & III. $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{2+k^5+\ln(k^{10})}{100k^5+3k}$ \\
&& \\
IV. $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{5\cdot 2^{1+3k}}{3^{2k}}$ \hspace{.2in} & V. $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{3^k + k}$ \hspace{.2in} & VI. $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \left(\frac{k^2}{0.9k^2+k^{1/2}}\right)^{5k}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{freeResponse}
I. The Limit Comparison Test would be useful here. Noting that the dominant term in the numerator is $8k^2$ and the dominant term in the denominator is $k^4$, the series compares naturally with $\sum \frac{8}{k^2}$.

II. Since the terms of the series involve factorials, the Ratio Test would be useful.

III. By inspection, it is easy to see that the Divergence Test implies that this series diverges.

IV. By rewriting the terms of the series using exponent rules, we see that this is a geometric series. This can be used to easily determine whether or not the series converges.

V. The Comparison Test would be useful here, since $\frac{1}{3^k + k} \leq \frac{1}{3^k}$ for all $k$, and $\sum \frac{1}{3^k}$ converges.

VI. Since the terms of the series are raised to the power $5k$, the Root Test would be useful.

\section{Group Work}

\begin{problem}
Determine whether the following series converge or diverge and justify your claim.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
I. $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{3-\cos(2k)}{k^2}$ \hspace{.3in} II. $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{5k^3+3k^2}{100 + k^7 + \ln(k)}$ \hspace{.3in} III. $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{5^k + k^5}{3^{k+1}}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{freeResponse}
I. Noting that $|\cos(2k)| \leq 1$ for all $k$, we have
$$
\frac{3-\cos(2k)}{k^2} \leq \frac{4}{k^2}
$$
for all $k$. Since $\sum \frac{4}{k^2}$ converges (by the $p$-Series Test), the series we are interested in must converge, by the Comparison Test.

II. Examining the terms in the series, we see that for large values of $k$, the terms behave like $5k^3/k^7$, or $5/k^4$. We then emply the Limit Comparison Test,
\begin{align*}
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{(5k^3+3k^2)/(100+k^7+\ln(k))}{5/k^4} &= \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{5k^7 + 3k^6}{500+5k^7 + 5\ln(k)} \\
&= \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}  \frac{5k^7}{5k^7} \\
&= 1.
\end{align*}
Since $\sum \frac{5}{k^4}$ converges, the Limit Comparison Test implies that the series we are interested in must also converge.

III. We compare this series with $\sum (5/3)^k$. We have 
\begin{align*}
\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{5^k + k^5}{3^{k+1}} \cdot \frac{3^k}{5^k} &= \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{15^k + 3^k k^5}{3 \cdot 15^k} \\
&= \frac{1}{3}.
\end{align*}
Since $\sum (5/3)^k$ is a geometric series with ratio $> 1$, it diverges. The Limit Comparison Test therefore implies that hte series we are interested in must also diverge.
