\begin{sectionOutcomes}
After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}

\item Understand the connection between continuity of a function and
  the value of a limit.
\item Make a piece-wise function continuous.
\item State the Intermediate Value Theorem including hypotheses.
\item Determine if the Intermediate Value Theorem applies.
\item Sketch pictures indicating why the Intermediate Value Theorem is
  true, and why all hypotheses are necessary.
\item Explain why certain points exist using the Intermediate Value
  Theorem.
\item Bisection method.
\end{itemize}
