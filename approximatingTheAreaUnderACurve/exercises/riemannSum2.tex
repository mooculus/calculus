Consider the function
\[
\sqrt{4-x^2}
\]
on the interval $[-2,2]$.

Consider approximating the area between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis using a Midpoint Riemann sum with $n=4$ subintervals.  In this case
\begin{align*}
\Delta x &= \answer{1}\\
x_1^* &= \answer{\frac{-3}{2}}\\
x_2^* &= \answer{\frac{-1}{2}}\\
x_3^* &= \answer{\frac{1}{2}}\text{ and}\\
x_4^* &= \answer{\frac{3}{2}}.
\end{align*}

This gives us that our Midpoint Riemann sum approximated to two decimals is $\answer{6.52}$.

Now consider approximating the same area with a Left Riemann sum with $n=4$ subintervals.  In this case
\begin{align*}
\Delta x &= \answer{1}\\
x_1^* &= \answer{-2}\\
x_2^* &= \answer{-1}\\
x_3^* &= \answer{0}\text{ and}\\
x_4^* &= \answer{1}.
\end{align*}

This gives us that our Left Riemann sum is
\[
\answer{2+2\sqrt{3}}.
\]
Approximated to two decimals, this is $\answer{5.46}$.

Finally, the exact area between the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis on the interval $[-2,2]$ is
\[
\answer{2\pi}
\]

\begin{hint}
Graph $f$. What shape is its graph?
