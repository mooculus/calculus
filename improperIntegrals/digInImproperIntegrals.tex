\end{abstract}
\maketitle


Recall that we introduced the definite integral

\[
\int_a^b f(x) \d x,
\]

as a limit of Riemann Sums. This limit need not always exist, as it depended on the properties of the
function $f$ on the given interval $[a, b]$. In particular, in order for the construction of the integral to work 
we needed both of the following to be true: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The interval over which we integrated, $[a,b]$, must be a finite length
  interval, and
\item The function $f$ must be bounded on $[a,b]$.
\end{itemize}


\begin{remark}
Recall that in order for a function defined on $[a, b]$ to be bounded on $[a,b]$, there needs to exist an some real number $M>0$ such that 
\[
|f(x)| \leq M \text{ for all } x \text{ in } [a, b]
\]

This says that the outputs of $f$ are trapped between the horizontal lines $y=-M$ and $y=M$. Thus the output values cannot 
become arbitrarily large in either the positive or negative sense on $[a,b]$. 
\end{remark}


It turns out that there are many instances where these limitations are a problem.  For instance, there are applications in statistics, physics, and engineering where we need to integrate over unbounded regions or we need to integrate unbounded functions.  In this section, we will generalize the notion of the integral in such a way to overcome each of the restrictions above.



\begin{definition}
  An integral
  \[
  \int_a^b f(x) \d x,
  \]
  is called an \dfn{improper integral} if one of, or both, of the conditions hold:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The region you are integrating over is infinite.
  \item The function $f$ is unbounded on the interval $[a,b]$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{question}
  Which of the following integrals are improper according to the previous definition?
  \begin{selectAll}
    \choice{$\int_{-1}^{100} \frac{1}{1+x^2} \d x$}

  \end{selectAll}
\end{question}





\section{Unbounded intervals}


Consider the expression
\[ 
\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x) \d x
\]
What does this expression mean?  Let's consider a particular example and see if we can make sense of it.

\begin{example}
Evaluate the improper integral
\[ 
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \d x
\]
\begin{explanation}

We interpret definite integrals as giving us the net area underneath the graph of the function over the given interval. If we used this interpretation here, this notation should mean that we want to find the area under $\frac{1}{x}$ from $1$ to $\infty$.  This idea needs to be more precisely defined.  Let's consider the definite integral
\[
\int_{1}^{N} \frac{1}{x} \d x=\eval{\ln|x|}_{1}^{N}=\ln(N)
\]

where $N \geq 1$ is some fixed number. 
 This integral gives us the area underneath $1/x$ from $1$ to $N$. If we wanted to make sense of the integral to $\infty$, we could think of letting $N$ 
get larger and larger and seeing how this affects the area. 

That is, we interpret the integral from 1 to $\infty$ as a limit of a definite integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \d x= \lim_{N \to \infty} \int_{1}^{N} \frac{1}{x} \d x= \lim_{N \to \infty} \ln(N) = \infty
\]

We can interpret this result to mean that the area under $\frac{1}{x}$ from $1$ to $\infty$ is infinite.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

It might seem like we should always get an answer of infinity or negative infinity if we integrate over an unbounded region, but the next example shows that is not always the case.

\begin{example}
Compute 
\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x
\]

\begin{explanation}
The previous example shows us we should consider this expression to be the limit of a definite integral 
in the following manner:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x=\lim_{N \to \infty} \int_{1}^{N} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x
\]

We calculate the definite integral 
\[
\int_{1}^{N} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x= \eval{\frac{-1}{x}}_{1}^{N}=1-\frac{1}{N}
\]

This gives the area under $1/x^{2}$ on the interval $[1, N]$. Now we take the limit of this area as $N \to \infty$. 

\[
\int_{1}^{N} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x= \lim_{N \to \infty} 1-\frac{1}{N}=1
\]
  
In this case, when we take the limit, we get a finite number, namely $1$. This suggests that we can consider the 
area under $1/x^{2}$ from $1$ to $\infty$ to be equal to $1$ despite the fact that the region is unbounded. 



\end{explanation}
\end{example}





%In the previous two examples we have seen we can assign a meaning to expressions like $\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x) \d x$
%by interpreting such an expression as shorthand for the following limit.

%\[
%\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x) \d x:=\lim_{N \to \infty} \int_{a}^{N} f(x) \d x
%\]
%
%We say that such integrals are \textbf{improper}. We will see other types of improper integrals later. 

%If the limit exists, that is, the limit is equal to a finite number $L$, then we say that the improper integral converges and we say the integral is equal to $L$. 
%If the limit does not exist, we say that the improper integral diverges. 


Thus in the two examples we have studied so far we have 


\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \d x = \infty
\]

    \addplot [penColor,very thick, smooth,domain=.5:10] {1/x};
   \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

and 

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x =1
\]


\begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
      xmin=-.5, xmax=6,ymin=-.5,ymax=2,domain=.001:1,
      axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
      every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
      every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
      axis on top,
      width=6in,
      height=3in,
    ] 
    \addplot [draw=none, fill=fillp,domain=1:10 ] {1/x^2} \closedcycle;
    \addplot [penColor,very thick, smooth,domain=.5:10] {1/x^2};
   \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

Why do we get such different answer in these two cases?  The difference lies in the speed with which each function approaches $0$ as $x \to \infty$. Although both functions approach $0$ as $x \to \infty$, the function $\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ becomes smaller much more rapidly than $\frac{1}{x}$. 
We can see in the graphs above that $\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ shrinks down to zero much more quickly. The key idea is that the area that we are accumulating as $x\to \infty$ is shrinking rapidly enough that the total area stays bounded. This is a theme we will see again when we study convergence of series. 

We now give a precise definition for integrals over unbounded regions.

\begin{definition}\hfil
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[a,\infty)$.
  \[
  \int_a^\infty f(x) \d x \text{ is defined to be } \lim_{b\to\infty}\int_a^b f(x) \d x
  \]
\item Let $f$ be a continuous function on $(-\infty,b]$.
  \[
  \int_{-\infty}^b f(x) \d x \text{ is defined to be } \lim_{a\to-\infty}\int_a^b f(x) \d x
  \]
\item Let $f$ be a continuous function on $(-\infty,\infty)$. Let $c$
  be any real number.
  \[
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \d x \text{ is defined to be }
  \]
  \[
  \lim_{a\to-\infty}\int_a^c f(x) \d x + \lim_{b\to\infty}\int_c^b
  f(x) \d x
  \]
\end{itemize}
An improper integral is said to \dfn{converge} if its corresponding
limit exists and is equal to a real number. Otherwise, the improper
integral is said to \dfn{diverge}. In this case, the integral either
does not exist, or is equal to $-\infty$ or $\infty$.
\end{definition}

\begin{warning}
  The improper integral
  \[
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \d x
  \]
  converges if and only if \textbf{both}
  \[
  \lim_{a\to-\infty}\int_a^c f(x) \d x
  \]
  and
  \[
  \lim_{b\to\infty}\int_c^b
  f(x) \d x
  \]
  converge to real numbers.
\end{warning}

A question for the young mathematician: Suppose that the improper
integral $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \d x$ exists.  Why does it not
matter which $c$ you choose to split the integral up at?


\begin{example}
Determine whether the integral
\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \d x 
\]
converges or diverges. If it converges, determine the value of the integral. 
\begin{explanation}
Here both of the bounds of integration involve $\infty$ so to reinterpret the integral in terms of limits of definite integrals, 
we must first break up the integral into two pieces.

\begin{align*}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \d x&= \int_{-\infty}^{0} \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \d x + \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \d x \\
& =\lim_{M \to -\infty} \int_{M}^{0} \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \d x + \lim_{N \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \d x 
\end{align*}
 
Now we must look at each integral separately. 

\[
\int_{0}^{N} \frac{1}{1+x^2} \d x =  \answer{\arctan(N)}
\]


Similarly we obtain

\[
\int_{M}^{0} \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \d x= \answer{-\arctan(M)}
\]
 
\begin{hint}
Recall that 
  \[
  \int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \d x = \arctan(x)+C,
  \]
  \end{hint}

Now we take the limits of each integral

\begin{question}
Determine the following limits:

 \begin{prompt}
   \[
    \lim_{N\to\infty} \arctan(N) = \answer{\pi/2}
    \]

\[
\lim_{M \to -\infty} -\arctan(M)=\answer{\pi/2}
\]
  \end{prompt}
\end{question}

Hence we have

\[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \d x=\lim_{M \to -\infty} \int_{M}^{0} \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \d x + \lim_{N \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+x^{2}} \d x =\answer{ \pi}
\]
In this example, both integrals converge and therefore the entire integral converges. 
\end{explanation}
\end{example}







\begin{example}	
  Compute:
  \[
  \int_{-\infty}^{-1}\frac{-1}{x\sqrt{x^2-1}} \d x
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    Write with me,
    \begin{align*}
      \int_{-\infty}^{-1} \frac{1}{x\sqrt{x^2-1}} \d x &= \lim_{a \to -\infty} \int_{a}^{-1} \frac{-1}{x\sqrt{x^2-1}}\d x\\
      &= \lim_{a \to -\infty} \eval{\answer[given]{\arcsec(x)}}_{a}^{-1} \\
      &= \lim_{a \to -\infty} \left(\arcsec(-1) - \arcsec(a)\right)\\
      &= \answer[given]{\pi - \frac{\pi}{2}}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{explanation}
  \end{example}

\begin{example}	
  Compute:
  \[
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty \sin(\theta) \d \theta
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    Write with me:
    \[
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty \sin(\theta) \d \theta = \lim_{a\to -\infty} \int_a^c \sin(\theta) \d \theta + \lim_{b\to\infty}\int_c^b \sin(\theta) \d \theta.
    \]
    Let us evaluate these limits one at a time:
    \begin{align*}  
      \lim_{a\to -\infty}\eval{-\cos(\theta)}_a^c &= \lim_{a\to -\infty}\left(-\cos(c)+\cos(a)\right)\\
      &= \lim_{a\to -\infty} \cos(a) -\cos(c)\\
      &= \answer[given]{DNE}.
    \end{align*}
    We can stop here. Since one limit was infinite, the integral is
    divergent, and hence does not exist (DNE). We do not need to evaluate the other integral.
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}


\begin{warning}
In the last example, what would have happened if we had tried to
compute the indefinite integral with \textbf{a single limit}?
\[
\lim_{c\to \infty}\int_{-c}^c \sin(\theta)\d \theta?
\]
Since sine is an odd function on any bounded interval $[-c,c]$, we
would have found this integral to be $0$. However,
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \sin(\theta) \d \theta \ne \lim_{c\to \infty}\int_{-c}^c \sin(\theta)\d \theta.
\]
We must compute \textbf{two limits} to correctly evaluate this
integral.
\end{warning}










\section{Unbounded functions}

We have just considered definite integrals where the interval of
integration was unbounded. We now consider another type of improper
integration, where the interval is finite but the function is unbounded on the interval. 




Let's begin with some examples.

\begin{example}	
  Compute:
  \[
  \int_{0}^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \d x
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
Here the problem is that the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$ is unbounded on $[0,1]$. That is, $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$ gets arbitrarily large as $x$ 
approaches $0$ from the right. Such an integral is improper. What exactly do we mean by such an expression. Suppose though that we keep our function from reaching $0$. Suppose $a$ lies strictly between $0$ and $1$. Then consider the definite integral

\[
\int_{a}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \d x
\]

The function is now bounded on this smaller interval. 

\[
\int_{a}^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \d x=  \eval{\answer[given]{2\sqrt{x}}}_a^1=\answer{2-2\sqrt{a}}
\]

Now we can examine what will happen if we let $a$ begin to move towards $0$ from the right. What will happen to the area
under the curve? 
Just as we did in the case of unbounded integrals, we can make sense of this integral by defining it as the limit
of a definite integral 

\[
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \d x=\lim_{a \to 0^{+}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \d x
\]
We can then evaluate our original improper integral: 
    \begin{align*}
      \int_{0}^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \d x &= \lim_{\answer[given]{a} \to 0} \int_{a}^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \d x \\
      &=  \lim_{a \to 0}  \eval{\answer[given]{2\sqrt{x}}}_a^1 \\
      &=  \lim_{a \to 0} \left(\answer[given]{2-2\sqrt{a}}\right)\\
      &= \answer[given]{2}.
    \end{align*}

Isn't it quite surprising that the area bounded by a curve which has a
vertical asymptote can be finite? Consider the graph of $y=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$ on the interval $[0,1]$:
\begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
      xmin=-3, xmax=3,ymin=-1,ymax=3,domain=.01:1,
      axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
      every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
      every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
      axis on top,
      width=6in,
      height=3in,
    ] 
    \addplot [draw=none, fill=fillp] {1/sqrt(x)} \closedcycle;
    \addplot [penColor,very thick, smooth,domain=.01:1] {1/sqrt(x)};
    \addplot [penColor,very thick, smooth,domain=1:3] {1/sqrt(x)};
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}
Essentially, the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$ goes to infinity ``fast
enough,'' as $x\to 0^+$, so that only a finite amount of area is
accumulated. 

  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

Now we look at another example: 

\begin{example}	
  Compute:
  \[
  \int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{x^2} \d x
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    The function $\frac{1}{x^2}$ has a vertical asymptote at $a=0$. Since the problematic point 
occurs in the middle of the interval we need to break the integral into two pieces.
  We have
\begin{align*}
  \int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x =&= \int_{-1}^{0} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x + \int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x \\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_{a}^1 \frac{1}{x^2} \d x  + \lim_{b \to 0^-} \int_{-1}^{b} \frac{1}{x^2} \d x.
 \end{align*}
  Let us evaluate these limits one at a time.
  \begin{align*}
    \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_{a}^1 \frac{1}{x^2} \d x  &=  \lim_{\answer[given]{a} \to 0^+} \eval{\answer[given]{\frac{-1}{x}}}_a^1 \\
    &=  \lim_{a \to 0^+} \frac{1}{a}-1\\
    &= \infty.
  \end{align*}
    We can stop here. Since one limit was infinite, the integral is
    divergent, and hence does not exist (DNE). 
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{remark}
We encountered the integral
\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x 
\]

earlier and saw that this integral converges. We remarked at the time this was due to how rapidly the function approached $0$ as $x \to \infty$. 

However the integral

\[
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x 
\]

diverges. The issue is that the integral is approaching the vertical asymptote $x=0$ too slowly and thus the area builds up too quickly. This is due to the fact that the manner in which $\frac{1}{x^{2}}$ approaches the horizontal asymptote $y=0$ is different from the manner in which 
it approaches the vertical asymptote $x=0$. 
\end{remark}


\begin{warning}
In the previous example,

\[
\int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x
\]

 what would have happened if had we \textbf{not
  noticed the vertical asymptote} in the integrand at $x=0$?

We probably would have blindly computed:
\begin{align*}
  \int_{-1}^1\frac1{x^2}\d x &= \eval{-\frac{1}{x}}_{-1}^1\\
  &= -1 - (1)\\
  &=-2
\end{align*}

But the integrand is always positive, so this answer of $-2$ is
complete nonsense! The reason this error occurs is because this expression is not a definite integral. It only has meaning if we
interpret it as a limit of definite integrals 
\[
 \int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{x^{2}} \d x = \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_{a}^1 \frac{1}{x^2} \d x  + \lim_{b \to 0^-} \int_{-1}^{b} \frac{1}{x^2} \d x.
\]


\textbf{Be on the lookout for vertical asymptotes!}
\end{warning}


We can now generalize the previous two examples to give a definition for such 
improper integrals of unbounded functions.

\begin{definition}
Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function on $[a,b]$ except at $c$, $a\leq
c\leq b$, where $x=c$ is a vertical asymptote of $f$. Define
\[
\int_a^b f(x)\d x = \lim_{t\to c^-}\int_a^t f(x)\d x + \lim_{t\to c^+}\int_t^b f(x)\d x
\]
\end{definition}

Let's look at a couple more examples. 


\begin{example}
  Compute:
  \[
  \int_0^1 \ln(x)\d x
  \]
  \begin{explanation}
    Since $\lim_{x\to 0^+} \ln(x) = -\infty$, the natural logarithm
    has a vertical asymptote at $x = 0$. Thus, we have
    \begin{align*}
    \int_0^1 \ln(x) \d x &=\lim_{\answer[given]{t}\to 0^+} \int_t^1 \ln(x) \d x \\
    &= \lim_{t\to 0^+} \eval{\answer[given]{x \ln(x)-x}}_t^1 \\
    &=\lim_{t \to 0^{+}} ( -1 + t - t\ln(t) ) \\
&=\answer{ -1} 
      \end{align*}
\begin{hint}
The limit 
\[
\lim_{t \to 0^{+}} t\ln(t)
\]
was the form $0\cdot -\infty$. By rewriting it in the appropriate way, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule to 
determine the limit. 
\end{hint}
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}


\begin{example}
Determine the integral
\[
\int_{1}^{4} \frac{5x}{x^{2}+x-6} \d x 
\]


\begin{explanation}
 The integrand is a rational function so we check whether the denominator has a root in $[1,4]$. 
Factoring the denominator $x^{2}+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$ so we see that $x=2$ makes the denominator zero 
and lies in the interval of integration. 

Since $2$ lies in the middle of the interval we need to break the integral into two pieces
\begin{align*}
\int_{1}^{4} \frac{5x}{x^{2}+x-6} \d x &= \int_{1}^{2} \frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+3)} \d x  + \int_{2}^{4} \frac{5x}{x^{2}+x-6} \d x \\
      &=\lim_{a \to 2^{-}} \frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+3)} \d x + \lim_{b \to 2^{+}} \int_{b}^{4} \frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+3)} \d x
\end{align*}

Since the integrand is a rational function, where the denominator is reducible, we could apply partial fractions decomposition to get

\[
\frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+3)}=\frac{ 2}{x-2} +\frac{ 3}{x+3}
\]


Now we find the antiderivative to get 
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+3)} \d x&=\int \frac{ 2}{x-2} \d x + \int \frac{ 3}{x+3} \d x \\
=& 2\ln|x-2| + 3\ln|x+3 | + C
\end{align*}


Now we evaluate 

\begin{align*}
\lim_{b \to 2^{+}} \int_{b}^{4} \frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+3)} \d x&= \lim_{b \to 2^{+}} \eval{ 2\ln|x-2| + 3\ln|x+3 | }_{b}^{4} \\
&=\lim_{b \to 2^{+}} (2\ln(2) + 3 \ln(7) - 2\ln|b-2| -3\ln|b+3| ) \\
&=2\ln(2) +3\ln(7)-3\ln(5) + \infty=\infty
\end{align*}

Thus this integral diverges, so the entire integral must diverge. 

\end{explanation}

%  How much work is required to move an $m\unit{kg}$ object from the
%  surface of the Earth out to a distance where the gravitation force
%  between the object and the Earth can be disregarded?
%
%  As a gesture of friendship, we will tell you the following facts:
%  The force of gravity between two objects of mass $M$ and $m$ in
%  kilograms at a distance of $x$ meters is given by
%  \[
%  F(x) = G\cdot \frac{m\cdot M}{x^2},
%  \]
%  where $G$ is the gravitational constant. 
%  \begin{explanation}
%    To start, we will work in terms of $m$, $M$, and $G$. In this
%    problem we are accumulating large forces over infinitesimal
%    distances. Hence
%    \begin{align*}
%      \d W &= F \d x\\
%      &= \answer[given]{G\cdot \frac{m\cdot M}{x^2}} \d x
%    \end{align*}
%    We can approximate ``really, really far away'' with ``infinitely
%    far away''. Write with me,
%    \begin{align*}
%      \mathrm{Work} &= \int_1^\infty F \d x\\
%      &= \int_1^\infty G\frac{m\cdot M}{x^2} \d x\\
%      &= G\cdot m\cdot M \lim_{\answer[given]{b} \to \infty} \eval{\answer[given]{-\frac{1}{x}}}_1^b\\
%      &=G\cdot m\cdot M \lim_{b \to \infty} \left(\answer[given]{1 - \frac{1}{b}}\right)\\
%      &=\answer[given]{G\cdot m\cdot M}.
%    \end{align*}
%  \end{explanation}
