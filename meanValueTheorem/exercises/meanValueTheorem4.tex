The population (in millions of cells) of a culture of bacteria is given by the function $P$ where $t$ is measured in weeks after some start date.

Below is a partial table of values of $P(t)$.
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
t & 0 & 1 & 3 & 4\\\hline
P(t) & 0 & 50 & 75 & 80\\\hline
\end{array} 
\]
\begin{exercise}
Compute the average rate of change of the population during the time interval $[0,4]$.

The average rate of change of the population during the time interval $[0,4]$ is $\answer{20}$ million cells per week.
\end{exercise}
\begin{exercise}
Suppose that  the function $P$ is continuous on $[0,10)$ and differentiable on $(0,10)$. Then  on the interval $[0,4]$ the function $P$  \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{satisfies}\choice{does not satisfy}} the conditions of the Mean Value Theorem so \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{there exists}\choice{there does not necessarily exist}} a $0<c<4$ such that $P'(c)$ equals the above calculated average rate of change of the population.

That means that at the time $t=c$ the \textbf{instantaneous rate of change} of the population is equal to the \textbf{average rate of change} of the population during the time interval $[0,4]$.
\end{exercise}
