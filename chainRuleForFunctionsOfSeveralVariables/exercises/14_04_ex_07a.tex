\begin{exercise}
Consider the ideal gas law, given by $PV=nRT$, relating pressure, $P$, volume, $V$, and the temperature $T$ of $n$ moles of gas, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant. We can view $P$, $V$ and $T$ each as functions of the other two variables. 

If the pressure of a gas is increasing at a rate of $0.2\unit{Pa/min}$ and temperature is increasing at a rate of $1\unit{K/min}$, how fast is the volume changing? Express your answer in terms of $P$, $V$, $n$, and $R$ alone.

\begin{prompt}
\[
\dd[V]{t}=\answer{\frac{n R-0.2 V}{P}}
\]
