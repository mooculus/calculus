\begin{problem}
What is the value of $F(1,0)$?
\begin{prompt}
\[
  F(1,0) = \answer{9}

\begin{problem}
Estimate $F^{(1,0)}(1,0)$ as we did in the textbook and class.
\begin{prompt}
\[
  F^{(1,0)}(1,0) \approx \answer{-15}

\begin{problem}
Estimate $F^{(0,1)}(1,0)$ as we did in the textbook and class.
\begin{prompt}
\[

\begin{problem}
  Use your work above to give an \textbf{explicit} equation of a
  tangent plane to the graph of $F(x,y)$ at the point $(1,0)$ in terms
  of $x$ and $y$.
\begin{prompt}
\[
z = \answer{9 + (-30)(x - 1) + (-120)(y)}

\begin{problem}
  Let $\vecl(t)$ be the vector-valued function describing the line
  starting at the point $(2,-1)$ that passes through $(0,1)$ as $t$
  runs from $0$ to $1$.  Use your work above to estimate
  $\dd{t}F(\vecl(t))$ at $t = 1/2$.
  \begin{prompt}
  \[
  \eval{\dd{t} F(\vecl(t))}_{t=1/2} \approx \answer{-180}
