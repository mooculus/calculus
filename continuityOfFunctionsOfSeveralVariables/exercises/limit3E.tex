\begin{exercise}

Consider $ \lim_{\point{x,y}\to \point{0,0}}\frac{2x^2+3 x y}{4y^2-3xy}$.
    
    To determine if this limit exists, consider the outputs of the function $F(x,y) = \frac{2x^2+3 x y}{4y^2-3xy}$ along the line $y = m x$.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item When $m = 1$, $F(x,y)$ approaches $\answer{5}$ as $\point{x,y} \to \point{0,0}$ along $y= x$.
    \item When $m = 2$, $F(x,y)$ approaches  $\answer{4/5}$  as $\point{x,y} \to \point{0,0}$ along $y= 2 x$.
    \item Leaving $m$ unspecified, $F(x,y)$ approaches  $\answer{\frac{2+3m}{4m^2-3m}}$  as $\point{x,y} \to \point{0,0}$ along $y= m x$.
    \end{itemize}
  
\begin{exercise}  
  Does the limit exist? If it does, indicate its value and if it does not exist, write $\verb|DNE|$.

  \[
  \lim_{\point{x,y}\to \point{0,0}}\frac{2x^2+3 x y}{4y^2-3xy} = \answer{DNE}
  \]
  
  \begin{feedback}[correct]
  Note that \emph{if} the limit exists, the function must approach the same value along any path as $\point{x,y} \to \point{0,0}$.  we can conclude that the limit does not exist by noting either of the following.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The function approaches a different value as $\point{x,y} \to \point{0,0}$ along the path $y=x$ than it does as $\point{x,y} \to \point{0,0}$ along the path $y=2x$.
  \item The value the function approaches as $\point{x,y} \to \point{0,0}$ along the path $y=mx$ depends on the choice of $m$ (and thus on the choice of straight line path).
  \end{itemize}
