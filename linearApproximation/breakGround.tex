Two young mathematicians discuss linear approximation.

\maketitle

Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):



\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Hmmmm. Riley, I just thought of something\dots
\item[Riley] What is it?
\item[Devyn] When we compute derivatives, we are looking at the slope
  of tangent lines right?
\item[Riley] You know it.
\item[Devyn] Well, I wonder: Instead of studying curves, could we just
  study ``zoomed-in'' lines?
\item[Riley] I'm not sure\dots
\end{dialogue}


You read someplace that
\[
\l(x) = \frac{1}{4}(x-4)+2
\]
is a good approximation for $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ when $x$ is close to
$4$.

\begin{problem}
  Plot $\l(x)$ and $f(x)$. Explain how this shows that $\l(x)$ is a
  good approximation when $x$ is close to $4$.
  \begin{prompt}
  \begin{freeResponse}
  \end{freeResponse}
  \end{prompt}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
 Explain (if you can) using concepts of calculus to explain why
 $\l(x)$ is a good approximation for $f(x)$ when $x$ is close to $4$.
 \begin{prompt}
  \begin{freeResponse}
  \end{freeResponse}
