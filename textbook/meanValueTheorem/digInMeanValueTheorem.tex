Here are some interesting questions involving derivatives:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose you toss a ball into the air and then catch it. Must the
  ball's vertical velocity have been zero at some point?
\item Suppose you drive a car from toll booth on a toll road to
  another toll booth $30$ miles away in half of an hour. Must you have
  been driving at $60$ miles per hour at some point?
\item Suppose two different functions have the same derivative. What
  can you say about the relationship between the two functions?
\end{enumerate}

While these problems sound very different, it turns out that the
problems are very closely related. We'll start simply:

\begin{theorem}[Rolle's Theorem]\index{Rolle's Theorem} 
Suppose that $f$ is differentiable on the interval $(a,b)$, is
continuous on the interval $[a,b]$, and $f(a)=f(b)$.
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
            xmin=0, xmax=4.5,ymin=1,ymax=5,
            axis lines =left, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            xtick={1,2,3}, xticklabels={$a$,$c$,$b$},
            ytickmin=1, ytickmax=0,
            axis on top,
          ]       
          \addplot [draw=none, fill=fill1,domain=(1:3)] {5} \closedcycle;       
	  \addplot [very thick,penColor, smooth] {-(x-2)^2+4};
          \addplot [very thick,penColor2, smooth] {4};
          \node at (axis cs:.4,2.5) [penColor] {$f(x)$}; 
          \addplot [textColor,dashed] plot coordinates {(2,0) (2,4)};
          \addplot [textColor,dashed] plot coordinates {(1,3) (3,3)};
          \addplot[color=penColor3,fill=penColor3,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(2,4)};  %% closed hole          
          \addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(1,3)};  %% closed hole          
          \addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(3,3)};  %% closed hole          
        \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

%% \end{marginfigure}
\end{image}
Then
\[
f'(c)=0
\]
for some $a<c<b$.
%% \begin{explanation}
%% By the Extreme Value Theorem, Theorem, we know that $f$ has a
%% maximum and minimum value on $[a,b]$.

%% If maximum and minimum both occur at the endpoints, then
%% $f(x)=f(a)=f(b)$ at every point in $[a,b]$. Hence the function is a
%% horizontal line, and it has derivative zero everywhere on
%% $(a,b)$. We may choose any $c$ at all to get $f'(c)=0$.

%% If the maximum or minimum occurs at a point $c$ with $a<c<b$, then by
%% Fermat's Theorem, $f'(c)=0$.
%% \end{explanation}
\end{theorem}


We can now answer our first question above.

\begin{example}
Suppose you toss a ball into the air and then catch it. Must the
ball's vertical velocity have been zero at some point?
\begin{explanation}
  Let $p(t)$ be the position of the ball at time $t$. Our interval in question will be
  \[
  [t_\mathrm{start},t_\mathrm{finish}]
  \]
  we may assume that $p$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable
  on $(a,b)$. We may now apply Rolle's Theorem to see at some time
  $c$, $p'(c)=\answer[given]{0}$. Hence the velocity must be zero at
  some point.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

Rolle's Theorem is a special case of a more general theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Mean Value Theorem]\label{thm:mvt}\index{Mean Value Theorem}
Suppose that $f$ has a derivative on the interval $(a,b)$ and is
continuous on the interval $[a,b]$.
%\begin{marginfigure}[.5in]

	\begin{axis}[

            axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            xtick={1,2.04,5}, xticklabels={$a$,$c$,$b$},

Then
\[
f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
\]
for some $a<c<b$. 
%% \begin{explanation}
%% Let 
%% \[
%% m=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a},
%% \] 
%% and consider a new function $g(x)=f(x) - m(x-a)-f(a)$.  We know that
%% $g(x)$ has a derivative on $[a,b]$, since $g'(x)=f'(x)-m$. We can
%% compute $g(a)=f(a)- m(a-a)-f(a) =0$ and
%% \begin{align*}
%% g(b)=f(b)-m(b-a)-f(a)&=f(b)-{f(b)-f(a)\over b-a}(b-a)-f(a) \\
%% &=f(b)-(f(b)-f(a))-f(a)\\
%% &=0. 
%% \end{align*}
%% So $g(a) = g(b) = 0$. Now by Rolle's Theorem, that at some $c$,
%% \[
%% g'(c)=0\qquad\text{for some $a<c<b$}.
%% \]
%% But we know that $g'(c)=f'(c)-m$, so
%% \[
%% 0=f'(c)-m=f'(c)-\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
%% \]
%% Hence
%% \[
%% f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
%% \]
%% \end{explanation}
\end{theorem}

We can now answer our second question above.  

\begin{example}
Suppose you drive a car from toll booth on a toll road to another toll
booth $30$ miles away in half of an hour. Must you have been driving
at $60$ miles per hour at some point?

\begin{explanation}
If $p(t)$ is the position of the car at time $t$, and $0$ hours is the
starting time with $1/2$ hours being the final time, then we may
assume that $p$ is continuous on $[0,1/2]$ and differentiable on
$(0,1/2)$. Now the Mean Value Theorem states there is a time $c$
\[
p'(c) = \frac{30-0}{1/2} = \answer[given]{60}\qquad \text{where $0<c<1/2$.}
\]
Since the derivative of position is velocity, this says that the car
must have been driving at $60$ miles per hour at some point.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

Now we will address the unthinkable, could there be a continuous
function $f$ on $[a,b]$ whose derivative is zero on $(a,b)$ that is
not constant? As we will see, the answer is ``no.''

\begin{theorem} 
If $f'(x)=0$ for all $x$ in an interval $I$, then $f(x)$ is constant
on $I$.
\begin{explanation}
Let $a< b$ be two points in $I$. Since $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$
and differentiable on $(a,b)$, by the Mean Value Theorem we know
\[
\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c)
\]
for some $c$ in the interval $(a,b)$. Since $f'(c)=0$ we see that
$f(b)=f(a)$. %%BADBAD I would like to ask a question here.
Moreover, since $a$ and $b$ were arbitrarily chosen,
$f(x)$ must be the constant function.
\end{explanation}
\end{theorem}


Now let's answer our third question.

\begin{example}
Suppose two different functions have the same derivative. What can you
say about the relationship between the two functions?

\begin{explanation}
Set $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$, so $h'(x) = f'(x) -g'(x)$. Now $h'(x) = 0$
on the interval $(a,b)$. This means that $h(x) = k$ where $k$ is some
constant. Hence
\[
g(x) = f(x) + k.
\]
\end{explanation}
\end{example}


\begin{example}
Describe all functions whose derivative is $\sin(x)$.
\begin{explanation}
One such function is $-\cos(x)$, so all such functions have the form
$-\cos(x)+k$,
%% \begin{marginfigure}[0in]
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
            xmin=0, xmax=6.2,ymin=-4,ymax=4,domain=(0:6.2),
            axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            axis on top,
          ] 
          \addplot [very thick,penColor, smooth] {-cos(deg(x))};
          \addplot [very thick,penColor2!30!background, smooth] {-cos(deg(x))+1};
          \addplot [very thick,penColor3!30!background, smooth] {-cos(deg(x))-1};
          \addplot [very thick,penColor4!30!background, smooth] {-cos(deg(x))+2};
          \addplot [very thick,penColor5!30!background, smooth] {-cos(deg(x))-2};         
        \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
%% \caption{Functions of the form $-\cos(x)+k$, each of whose derivative is $\sin(x)$.}
%% \label{figure:cos+k}
%% \end{marginfigure}
\end{image}
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

Finally, let us investigate two young mathematicians who run to class.

\begin{example}
  Two students Devyn and Riley raced to class. Was there a point
  during the race that Devyn and Riley were running at exactly the
  same velocity?
  \begin{explanation}
    Let $P_\mathrm{Devyn}$ represent Devyn's position with respect to
    time, and let $P_\mathrm{Riley}$ represent Riley's position with
    respect to time. Let $t_\mathrm{start}$ be the starting time of
    the race, and $t_\mathrm{finish}$ be the end of the race. Set
    \[
    f(t) =P_\mathrm{Devyn}(t)-P_\mathrm{Riley}(t).
    \]
    Note, we may assume that $P_\mathrm{Devyn}$ and
    $P_\mathrm{Riley}(t)$ are continuous on
    $[t_\mathrm{start},t_\mathrm{finish}]$ and that they are
    differentiable on $(t_\mathrm{start},t_\mathrm{finish})$. Hence
    the same is true for $f$. Since both runners start and finish at
    the same place,
    \begin{align*}
    f(t_\mathrm{start}) = P_\mathrm{Devyn}(t_\mathrm{start})-P_\mathrm{Riley}(t_\mathrm{start}) &= \answer[given]{0}\qquad\text{and}\\
    f(t_\mathrm{finish})=P_\mathrm{Devyn}(t_\mathrm{finish})-P_\mathrm{Riley}(t_\mathrm{finish}) &= \answer[given]{0}.\\
    \end{align*}
    In fact, this shows us that the average rate of change of
    \[
    f(t) = P_\mathrm{Devyn}(t)-P_\mathrm{Riley}(t)
    \qquad\text{on}\qquad [t_\mathrm{start},t_\mathrm{finish}]
    \]
    is $\answer[given]{0}$. Hence by the mean value theorem, there is a point $c$
    \[
    t_\mathrm{start}\le c \le t_{\mathrm{finish}}
    \]
    with $f'(c) = \answer[given]{0}$. However,
    \[
    \answer[given]{0} = f'(x) = P_\mathrm{Devyn}'(c)-P_\mathrm{Riley}'(c).
    \]
    Hence at $c$,
    \[
    P_\mathrm{Devyn}'(c)=P_\mathrm{Riley}'(c),
    \]
    this means that there was a time when they were running at exactly the same velocity. 
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}
