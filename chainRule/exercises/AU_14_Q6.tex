\begin{exercise}
A boat sails \textbf{directly} toward a $100\unit{m}$ skyscraper that stands on the edge of a harbor. An observer stands at the front of the boat. Let $\theta$ formed by the lines connecting the top and the bottom of the skyscraper to the observer's head (for all intents and purposes, you may assume that the line from the bottom of the skyscraper and the outline of the skyscraper are perpendicular to each other). Let $x$ denote the horizontal distance of the boat from the building. Express the angle $\theta$ as a function of $x$.
\[
\theta(x)=\answer{\arctan(\frac{100}{x})}\unit{rad}
\]
\begin{exercise}
Now suppose the boat is sailing directly toward the skyscraper at $3\unit{m/s}$. This means that
\[
\frac{dx}{dt}=\answer{-3}\unit{m/s}
\]
\begin{exercise}
Using your previous answers, find $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$ when the boat is $x=300\unit{m}$ from the building.
\[
\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\answer{\frac{3}{1000}}\unit{rad/s}
\]
