\begin{sectionOutcomes}

After completing this section, students should be able to do the following.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Recognize when a limit is indicating there is a vertical asymptote.
	\item Evaluate the limit as $x$ approaches a point where there is a vertical asymptote.
	\item Match graphs of functions with their equations based on vertical asymptotes.
	\item Discuss what it means for a limit to equal $\infty$.
	\item Define a vertical asymptote.
	\item Understand the relationship between limits and vertical asymptotes.
	\item Calculate the limit as $x$ approaches $\pm \infty$ of common functions algebraically.
	\item Find the limit as $x$ approaches $\pm \infty$ from a graph.
	\item Define a horizontal asymptote.
	\item Define a slant asymptote.
        \item Approximate a slant asymptote from the graph of a
            function.
	\item Find slant asymptotes algebraically and graphically.
\end{itemize}
