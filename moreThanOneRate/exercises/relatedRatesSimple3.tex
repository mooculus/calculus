\begin{exercise}

A circle is expanding.  At time $t_0$, its radius is $2 \textrm{m}$,
and is growing at a rate of $4 \frac{\textrm{m}}{\textrm{s}}$.  At
what rate is its area growing at the time $t_0$?

SOLUTION:  


  Let $A$ be the area, and $r$ be the radius of the circle. 
  
  The given rate is
  
   \[
\dd[\answer{r}]{t} =4\frac{\textrm{m}}{\textrm{s}}
  \]
  
  
  The rate to be determined is 
  
   \[
 \Bigl[\dd[\answer{A}]{t}\Bigr]_  {t=t_0} 
  \]
  
   The equation relating $A$ and $r$ is
  
  
  \[
  A = \pi \answer{r^2}.
  \]



  Differentiating with respect to time, we have
  \[
  \dd[A]{t} = \pi\answer{2 r }\cdot\dd[\answer{r}]{t}.
  \]


\begin{hint}
  So at time $t_0$,
  \[
  \Bigl[\dd[A]{t}\Bigr]_  {t=t_0} = \pi (4) (4) \frac{\textrm{m}^2}{\textrm{s}}.
  \]
\end{hint}

\begin{prompt}
  \[
 \Bigl[\dd[A]{t}\Bigr]_  {t=t_0}  = \answer{16\pi}\frac{\textrm{m}^2}{\textrm{s}}
  \]
\end{prompt}

\end{exercise}
