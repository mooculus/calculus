Check out this dialogue between two calculus students (based on a true
story):

\begin{dialogue}
\item[Devyn] Riley! How do you know when you are doing a calculus problem?
\item[Riley] Hmmm. I guess if you take a derivative you are doing a calculus problem.
\item[Devyn] What else?
\end{dialogue}

\begin{problem}
  Let's hear your answer to Devyn's question above.
  \begin{freeResponse}
    Answer will vary.
